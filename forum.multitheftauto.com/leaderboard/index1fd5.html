	If you're a server owner, please take note of the Changes in 1.5.9 wiki page, more specifically the Backwards Incompatible Changes. You may need to update your scripts for 1.5.9.
 


	Servers: binaries are available. Don't forget to update your default resourcesï»¿ï»¿ï»¿.

	Twitch
 


	We hosted a community livestream event at the end of July which was very nice! We hung out and played MTA with you on various servers. You can watch a recording of the livestream on our YouTube channel at https://youtu.be/n2KcspT0F0A. We wish to do more of these livestreams soon!
 


	Merch
 


	We launched a 100% non-profit merch store on Spreadshirt earlier this year! If you feel like getting some of that official MTA swag, check out the merch store here: https://multitheftauto.myspreadshop.net/all and wear that MTA gang drip at school or work.
 


	AMX (SAMP)



	amx is a software package that allows the execution of unmodified San Andreas: Multiplayer 0.3.7 gamemodes, filterscripts and plugins on Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.8 and higher servers. It is open source, and a prebuilt binary for Windows is available for testing purposes right now.
 


	The AMX team hopes that more people get involved with the development on GitHub as they need some help!
 


	Check out our GitHub repo for more information on how to use your SAMP scripts in MTA!
 


	1.5.9 Highlights



	This release includes many additions, improvements, and fixes:
 


	
		You can now use the new onPlayerResourceStart server-side event to trigger when client is ready! Thanks to @Lpsd
	
	
		You can now detect element interior or dimension change through two new client and server-side events onElementInteriorChange and onElementDimensionChange â should reduce some of your code! Thanks to @Patrick and @Strix
	
	
		You can now edit element bone behavior through 7 new bone manipulation functions! Great for some dynamic animations. Get started at setElementBonePosition and setElementBoneRotation. Thanks to @Saml1er
	
	
		More vehicle customisation options! You can now edit vehicle dummy positions per vehicle. See setVehicleDummyPosition. Thanks to @botder
	
	
		More audio customisation with sound effect parameters! See setSoundEffectParameter. Thanks to @Strix and @Sarrum
	
	
		More client download transfer box customisation options! See for example onClientTransferBoxProgressChange. Thanks to @botder and @CrosRoad95
	
	
		You can now allocate custom objects and vehicles through engineRequestModel. One of the most sought after features in a long time. Thanks to @TheNormalnij
	
	
		You can now use scalable vector graphics (SVG) in MTA! See svgCreate for more info. Thanks to @Lpsd
	
	
		You can now use peds and vehicles as the camera target. Thanks to @TheNormalnij
	
	
		A lot more features for scripters to build even more immersive experiences with!
	
	
		Many synchronization improvements!
	
	
		Many varying size fixes, quality of life improvements, updates and security enhancements!
	
	
		Many default resource fixes, refactors and upgrades, including webmap working once again! We have also improved the detection of world objects in map editor (editor_main resource), so you can select many more objects that you couldn't before - such as bushes, fences and many more! You can now also remove world objects inside interiors. This should help mappers a lot.
	



	If you are a scripter, you really should wanna dig in to these improvements! Show off your creations on our #showroom channel on our Discord server and have a chance at getting your work featured on our social media pages.
 


	Read the 1.5.9 release notes for a complete set of changes and more information about the improvements listed below. Watch or star our GitHub repository to keep on top of all the things we're working on.
 


	Important future script changes



	This will be the last 1.5 update and in the next version of MTA there will be numerous backwards incompatible changes and refactors that may affect old code. We will try to focus on making migration from 1.5.9 to the next version smooth for everyone.
 


	From 1.6 onwards we will be making at least the following changes:
 


	
		callRemote callbacks currently set the error code to nil when there is no error. In 1.6, to be consistent with fetchRemote, the error code reported will be 0. See GitHub #294.
	
	
		Since July 2016 if you provide an invalid string like "randomstring" when a function expects a number, the string will be treated as 0 and raise a script warning. In 1.6 this will be an error. You will still be able to provide strings containing numbers (e.g. "100" and "12.34"), this change only affects invalid strings. See GitHub #1043.
	
	
		When providing a width and height of (0, 0) to createBrowser or guiCreateBrowser you will encounter a script error instead of a warning. The warning was introduced Feb 2019. See GitHub #1069.
	
	
		Some functions expect only unsigned integers (positive numbers), and since Jan 2016 providing negative numbers would be a warning. This will now be an error. See GitHub #1070.
	
	
		Since Aug 2015, we replaced the custom mtalocal:// URL scheme with http://mta/resourceName/blah.html. This mtalocal:// URL scheme will now be removed. See GitHub #1071.
	



	This list is incomplete and we may introduce more changes later.
 


	What'sï»¿ next?



	Our eyes are now on the next version of MTA, which will break backwards compatibility in many ways as we work to refactor MTA's codebase.
 


	We are looking to host more community livestreams in the future, especially when we get further into the development of the next version of MTA. Stay tuned for more info most likely starting next year!
 


	We are also still working on our community 2.0 website with an internal goal of having phase 1 of development finished by August 2022. Latest news on this is that we've had major advancements on our stack which has been long overdue. We have also continued design on both backend and frontend. We will keep you updated should any news on this project surface.
 


	Multi Theft Auto depends on community input and contributions. To keep a project like MTA going we need LOTS of people. You can help in the following areas:
 


	Testing and bug reporting
 


	Whenever you encounter a bug or recognise a need for improvement, we can't fix it until you tell us your problem!
 


	We're continually working on new features and fixes for MTA, and this always needs testing. Join our Nightly release stream and make sure you keep in touch with on Discord and report issues on GitHub.
 


	Programming
 


	If you know C++ you may be interested in helping improve Multi Theft Auto's client. Working on open-source software may seem scary, but the best way is to try! Read GitHub's open source guide, and then find an itch to scratch, or scratch your own!
 


	Documentation
 


	Documentation is important, but also time consuming. If you enjoy writing and have some knowledge of English, or you would like to translate the English version to your native language, youâre very welcome to do so. Just head over to our wiki, create an account, and start editing!
 


	Support
 


	Do you like people? Can you give calm and thought-out responses to users needing help? Then you can spend some time providing support to those who need it. Many answers can be found on our wiki, so make sure to take some time to read it. Then, either join our chat or forums (linked below), or simply help us sort out issues and answer questions on the GitHub repository.
 


	Translation
 


	Want to translate MTA to your own language? Awesome! Visit us on Pootle. As soon as your translation is approved, it will be pushed to our repository for use in future releases.
 


	Donations
 


	Keeping the MTA downloads, master server and websites alive costs money! If you want to help us sustain our financial expenses, please donate!
 


	Show your creativity!
 


	We are actively looking for new creations on our #showroom channel on Discord, as well as #mtasa on Twitter for content we would like to repost on our social media pages and pin on our annual recap forum post.

	If you're a server owner, please take note of the Changes in 1.5.8 wiki page, more specifically the Backwards Incompatible Changes. You may need to update your scripts for 1.5.8.
 


	Servers: binaries are available. Do not forget to update your default resourcesï»¿ï»¿ï»¿.

	We now have a Twitch channel and @Woovie has been streaming almost daily the past week. We won't be streaming every day going forward, but do expect it pretty often!



	AMX (SAMP)



	amx is a software package that allows the execution of unmodified San Andreas: Multiplayer 0.3.7 gamemodes, filterscripts and plugins on Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.8 and higher servers. It is open source, and a prebuilt binary for Windows is available for testing purposes right now.
 


	Check out our GitHub repo for more information on how to use your SAMP scripts in MTA!
 


	1.5.8 Highlights



	This release includes many additions, improvements, and fixes:
 


	
		Add dxDrawPrimitive3D and dxDrawMaterialPrimitive3D (#760 by CrosRoad95)
	
	
		Add functions to modify dynamic objects' behaviour (#784 by forkerer)
	
	
		Add dynamic ped ID allocating using engineRequestModel and engineFreeModel (#349 by lopezloo + Neproify + Arran + qaisjp)
	
	
		Add functions to manipulate colshapes parameters (#1215 by StrixG)
	
	
		Add element data subscription functionality (#1055 by tederis)
	
	
		Add engineGetModelTextures function (#1058 by Lpsd)
	
	
		Trailer sync fix (#1247 by tederis)
	
	
		Added wheel scaling functions (#1641, #1644, and #1648 by AlexTMjugador)
	



	Read the 1.5.8 release notes for a complete set of changes and more information about the improvements listed below. Watch or star our GitHub repository to keep on top of all the things we're working on. Below is a very small subset of what we've improved:
 


	Important future script changes



	From 1.6 onwards we will be making at least the following changes:
 


	
		callRemote callbacks currently set the error code to nil when there is no error. In 1.6, to be consistent with fetchRemote, the error code reported will be 0. See GitHub #294.
	
	
		Since July 2016 if you provide an invalid string like "randomstring" when a function expects a number, the string will be treated as 0 and raise a script warning. In 1.6 this will be an error. You will still be able to provide strings containing numbers (e.g. "100" and "12.34"), this change only affects invalid strings. See GitHub #1043.
	
	
		When providing a width and height of (0, 0) to createBrowser or guiCreateBrowser you will encounter a script error instead of a warning. The warning was introduced Feb 2019. See GitHub #1069.
	
	
		Some functions expect only unsigned integers (positive numbers), and since Jan 2016 providing negative numbers would be a warning. This will now be an error. See GitHub #1070.
	
	
		Since Aug 2015, we replaced the custom mtalocal:// URL scheme with http://mta/resourceName/blah.html. This mtalocal:// URL scheme will now be removed. See GitHub #1071.
	



	This list is inconclusive and we may introduce more changes later.
 


	What'sï»¿ next?



	Multi Theft Auto depends on community input and contributions. To keep a project like MTA going we need LOTS of people. You can help in the following areas:
 


	Testing and bug reporting
 


	Whenever you encounter a bug or recognise a need for improvement, we can't fix it until you tell us your problem!
 


	We're continually working on new features and fixes for MTA, and this always needs testing. Join our Nightly release stream and make sure you keep in touch with on Discord and report issues on GitHub.
 


	Programming
 


	If you know C++ you may be interested in helping improve Multi Theft Auto's client. Working on open-source software may seem scary, but the best way is to try! Read GitHub's open source guide, and then find an itch to scratch, or scratch your own!
 


	Documentation
 


	Documentation is important, but also time consuming. If you enjoy writing and have some knowledge of English, or you would like to translate the English version to your native language, youâre very welcome to do so. Just head over to our wiki, create an account, and start editing!
 


	Support
 


	Do you like people? Can you give calm and thought-out responses to users needing help? Then you can spend some time providing support to those who need it. Many answers can be found on our wiki, so make sure to take some time to read it. Then, either join our chat or forums (linked below), or simply help us sort out issues and answer questions on the GitHub repository.
 


	Translation
 


	Want to translate MTA to your own language? Awesome! Visit us on Pootle. As soon as your translation is approved, it will be pushed to our repository for use in future releases.
 


	Donations
 


	Keeping the MTA downloads, master server and websites alive costs money! If you want to help us sustain our financial expenses, please donate!
 


	Thank you!

			Happy Spring Break! We have got a new release for you - Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.4!
 


	This release includes security updates for the server that protect both you and us, so we recommend all server owners to upgrade as soon as possible - see the steps below for tips on that. Failure to do so may affect your server's visibility on the Master Server List in the ingame server browser.
 


	Aside from security fixes, there are some feature updates in this version for the client as well, so regular players are more than welcome to update.
 


	 
 


	What do you need to do to upgrade your server properly
 


		
			Stop your server, then upgrade your server binaries like usual. You can also upgrade your server resources if you use any of the default MTA:SA ones.
		 
	
	
		Start your server, and when it is running, stop your server again (This will step will ensure mtaserver.conf is upgraded) 
		 
	
	
		Edit your mtaserver.conf file, and find &lt;owner_email_address&gt; (it should be just below the &lt;servername&gt; parameter) and insert a valid e-mail address that we can use to contact you, should there be an issue with your server. 
		This e-mail address IS NOT visible publicly and will only be used for means listed earlier. That is, only if those occur. 
		 
	
	
		Save the mtaserver.conf file, then start your server again.
	

	 
 


	Release Highlights
 


		Authorized Serial Account Protection is now enabled by default. To put it simply, this feature prevents players from logging in to an account on the server if their serial differs from the serial associated with that account. Naturally, this feature is configurable so you can restrict it to specific account groups and you can authorize more than just one serial for a specific account. You can also disable this in the mtaserver.conf file if you are sure you do not need the feature.
	
	
		Database Credentials Protection is now enabled by default.
	
	
		passwordHash() &amp; passwordVerify() can now be used to store and verify passwords securely and efficiently
	
	
		fetchRemote() now supports parallel downloads with the queue name parameter
	
	
		setWorldSpecialPropertyEnabled() now has settings for "sniper moon", "random foliage" and "extra air resistance"
	
	
		New scripting functions: get/setVehicleLODDistance()
	
	
		setElementDimension() now supports element omnipresence, which means that an element can be in all dimensions at once
	
	
		fixes for weapons/fists desync
	
	
		Corona markers should now have a correct attach offset position
	
	
		SQLite or MySQL no longer makes the server freeze if the connection is lost (#9520)
	
	
		Goggles no longer stay after player was killed (#9477)
	
	
		updates for CEF and other dependencies and redists
	
	
		fakelag command for testing sync issues
	
	
		fixes for some crashes and improvements for error handling for installation and startup issues
	
	
		removed max password length limit for server account passwords
	
	
		added server option to allow locally modified (gta3.img) vehicles
	
	
		added world special property "extraairresitance" to remove speed limiter on certain road sections (#7546)
	
	
		resource pack: various changes in acpanel, editor, freeroam, killmessages, playerblips, race and webbrowser
	
	
		... plus more!
	

	A complete list of changes can be found here (recommended read) and here (incomplete, from r10623 upwards). List of changes to the resource pack can be found here (starting from and including Oct 29, 2016 upwards).

			Hi there!
 


	Time sure flies fast, doesn't it? It has been a while since the last post from us so we would like to give you an update on what has been going on recently with MTA:SA. We have got two highlights for you this time. 
	 
 


	The community 
 


	Do you remember our Community website? It has served us well over the years but has also caught some rust in the process. Therefore, we would like to re-visit it and improve your experience with discovering and publishing resources. 
 


	Our plan is to build a new community website from the ground up using modern technologies, and we would like to hear from you what you would like to see on the new platform. Please respond to this thread with your ideas and suggestions.
 


	Technically inclined users can take a look at the first pass of our specification document. 
	 
 


	Development progress
 


	As for the mod itself, we have received many pull requests (patch contributions) on our GitHub from open source contributors lately.
 


	One of such contributions is a brand new feature: custom IFP animations support, coming from one of our community members, Saml1er. He managed to get this to work nicely in MTA:SA, while ensuring that our coding standards are met so we could include it without too much hassle.
 


	Saml1er even made a video which showcases what this feature is all about. You can find it below:
 


	
		
	



	 
 


	We intend this to be a part of our upcoming 1.5.6 release which we hope will come soon, but you can try it out now by using a nightly build: https://nightly.multitheftauto.com/
 


	Tips for using this can be found on our wiki: https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/EngineLoadIFP 
	 
 


	 
	 
 


	That's all for now. Take care and enjoy the summer!
 


	 
	â MTA Team

			A while ago we had published a release candidate build for the upcoming release for you folks to test. This phase went fine, so we feel that we are now ready to present you with the new stable version of the mod - Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.3!
 


	Just like before, this is an update for our current stable version series - MTA:SA 1.5. Contrary to this definition, it is rather a huge update which contains mostly smaller changes, but makes up for it with the amount of them. A lot of effort was put by @Jusonex and @sbx320 into cleaning the code and reorganizing the build system, both of which should make it easier for us to maintain MTA:SA's code base and simplify the compilation procedure. However, during the above mentioned RC testing phase we decided to revert some of the code clean-up changes and leave them for a future release due to problems they were causing. We feel it will be better that way as some of these changes simply need more work as they affect a lot of the code base, making it harder to pinpoint other issues that might be discovered. In the meantime, @ccw and @darkdreamingdan had worked on fixing bugs reported by the community. We also had updated several dependencies (third-party components which are used in our mod), including a bunch of utility libraries (such as sqlite, zlib, libpng or libjpeg) and the CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) components. The latter especially is an important change which we had explained further in a separate post and also summarized briefly below.
 


	This update will be slightly troublesome for some of our players who are still using Windows XP and Windows Vista (which is, to be honest, a rather small amount). Regular 1.5.3 build will not work for such users, so we had prepared a legacy build just for them. Furthermore, such users need to be prepared that at some point we might drop support for Windows XP and Windows Vista for our future releases.
 


	Please read this post to learn more about this change and its consequences.
 


	Since the build system was reorganized, a lot of smaller changes which were originally made for 1.6 were also introduced in this version (as long as they were not breaking the compatibility), making it actually one of the biggest releases we have ever made (and also sort of a bridge between 1.5 series and the then-upcoming 1.6 release). You can check the list below for some of the most interesting changes, but we really recommend checking full lists of changes to check whether the feature or function you have always wanted is already available in this release:
 


		Added support for German Steam version of GTA:SA (thanks to Lakota, Mario and @Sh4dowReturns for feedback)
	
	
		Improved streaming of low LOD objects and increased limits

		Water elements are now limited to a specific dimension
	
	
		Fixed sniper scope disappearing after killing a ped (thanks to lopezloo)
	
	
		Fixed MTA sometimes not loading custom textures
	
	
		Fixed MTA slowly updating position of attached elements
	
	
		Security and performance tweaks for CEF
	
	
		Fixed CEF popups (e.g. &lt;select&gt; boxes) not being rendered correctly
	
	
		Added option to block server admins who login with an unrecognized serial
	
	
		Added duplicate log line filter for script debugging
	
	
		Fixed a connecting player being able to block resources from starting
	
	
		Tweaked logic of client resource file validation
	
	
		Added server logging for redirectPlayer
	
	
		Tweaks for admin, missiontimer, race, runcode and webbrowser resources (thanks to Dutchman101, Einheit-101 and PhrozenByte)
	
	
		Added map backups for Map Editor and changed its default fps limiter setting value from 36 to 50 (thanks to AleksCore for the latter)
	
	
		Removed the no longer needed VS2008 redist package from the installer
	
	
		...and much more!
	

	A complete list of changes can be found here (recommended read) and here (incomplete, from r7816 upwards). List of changes to the resource pack can be found here (starting from and including Feb 18, 2016 upwards).
 


	Please be advised that UltraThing and older versions of ENB series mods are blocked in MTA:SA 1.5.3 due to their incompatibility with the MTA:SA web browser components.
 


		If you want to use ENB mod in 1.5.3, please update it to a newer version if your current one does not work.
	
	
		If, on the other hand, you want to use UltraThing mod in 1.5.3, you will not be able to do it anymore - sorry for that just like above - please update it to a newer version (v0.29 or above).
	

	 
 


	Want to download MTA:SA 1.5.3?  Click here to download the build for Win 7+. 
 


	Looking for a legacy build for XP/Vista? You can download it here.
 


	Or you can click here to go to our home page. Once there, click the Download button at the top center of the page, then choose your build and you are set.
 


	Linux server packages are also available.
 


	 
 


	This version is backwards compatible with our older 1.5 releases, but we still encourage everyone to update their clients and servers ASAP to ensure, that they benefit from bugfixes, security updates for CEF, performance tweaks or other improvements.
 


	 
 


	We would like to thank the following community members for their contributions to the MTA:SA source code, resources or feedback for this release:
 


	Aboshanab, AleksCore, braydondavis, Dutchman101, Einheit-101, Lakota, lex128, lopezloo, mabako, Mario, Necktrox, PhrozenByte, qaisjp, rafalh, @Sh4dowReturns, zneext
 


	(Have you contributed to MTA:SA 1.5.3's or 1.6's source code/resources pack but were not mentioned in the above list? PM @jhxp with a link to your contribution and you will be added)
 


	 
 


	We hope that you will enjoy this release. Also, please keep in mind that if you encounter a bug or a problem which was not present in previous versions, you can report it to our bugtracker.

			Hello.
	 

	
		2019 is nearing to an end, so here is our traditional "A year in Recap" post for you. Below you can find the summary of what has happened this year - along with the current status of an entry (where applicable) and other things that might be interesting to you.
	 

	
		 
	 

	
		? 2019 in Recap
	 

	
		
			
				Late January, we have refreshed our Forum Rules - we gave them a new look and rephrased a bunch of paragraphs to make them more clear and easier to follow.
			 
		
		
			
				In May, we have decided to drop support for Windows XP and Vista in our future releases. These operating systems are no longer supported by Microsoft and only a handful of our players still use them. We have advised our players to upgrade their PCs to newer Windows versions. While Windows 7 support will be soon ended by Microsoft as well, we still intend to support it in MTA:SA for a while.
			 
		
		
			
				In July, we have opened an User Guides section on our forums, which aims to provide our users with quality guides and tutorials for various MTA-related topics. We are still looking into improving this concept.
			 
		
		
			
				On 31st of August, we have released Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.7. This release was focused on performance improvements, minor scripting additions and bugfixes. It is still the current release and, as mentioned above, is the last main release for Windows XP and Vista.
			 
		
		
			
				On the same day, we have asked you guys to help us re-design our community website. The work on the new community is currently on hold however.
			 
		
		
			
				Later in September, Rockstar Games has released GTA: San Andreas for free on their launcher app (for a limited time). We have added support for it in MTA:SA shortly after.
			 
		
		
			
				26th of October marked the 15th anniversary of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas original release on PS2. While it was not the game we started with, it was the game that allowed us to make MTA the successful mod it is today.

		Player counts were lower than the ones from last year, but they're still large. Again, it's great to see that so many players are still interested in GTA:SA even though it's over 15 years old now!

			Hey, I wonder what this button does... &lt;presses the button&gt; huh? delete all forum users? oh sna-
 


	Hi there, 
	the MTA Team is happy to present you with the result of what we have been up to recently - the redesigned and refreshed MTA Forum!
 


	This is something that we have wanted to do for a long time, and for several reasons. The forum software we have used until now (phpBB) has served us well through the years, there is no doubt about that. However, as time went by, our needs were changing too. It was becoming less and less feasible for us to use and maintain the forums in their present state, so we decided it was time to try something that is more suited to our current needs. We were recently presented with an opportunity to switch the forum software on attractive terms and we took it. Lo and behold, here are the new forums!
 


	Highlights of new features that were not present on the previous forum:
 


		forum now runs on a proprietary, secure, well tested and widely used software solution - the IPS Community Suite
	
	
		a completely new, mobile-friendly forum theme
	
	
		a fully fledged rich text editor for posting or editing your content on the forums (instead of the previous plain text box with BBCode buttons)
	
	
		an improved user profile system for greater personalisation of your presence on our forums
	
	
		a new, customizable real-time notifications system
	
	
		also a new, simplified Private Messaging system
	
	
		improvements to the quotation system (quotes link to the original post, and are fully collapsible) and replying in general (the multiquote feature)
	
	
		an ability to 'like' and rate topics and posts, awarding reputation points to their authors
	
	
		topic authors can now assign tags to their topics, making it easier for users to find the content they are looking for
	
	
		several new enhancements and customization features to improve your browsing experience (eg. topic previews; the ability to hide forums you are not interested in)
	
	
		moderators now have an ability to promote your topic on the forum (similar to stickied topics, but separate to them)
	
	
		several new features for us administrators too, which will make forum maintenance easier and possibly allow us to implement new forum features without a hassle
	
	
		... and more!
	

	List of features that were present in the previous forum but are missing or are less functional now:
 


		no topic icons
	
	
		Private Messaging system is less pleasant to scroll through. Getting used to it might take some time too
	
	
		it is no longer possible to view the source code of posts. If you really need that functionality, you can check the page's HTML source code directly, then use a third party converter to obtain the BBCode
	
	
		code boxes are no longer integrated with the MTA wiki URLs
	

	 FAQ: 
	Q: Are my posts still in place? What about my private messages? 
	A: They are both fine. You can find them in the same place you left them before.
 


	Q: Will the old forum URLs still work? A bunch of places on the web link to your forum using old URLs... 
	A: Yes, they will work. We have a on-the-fly converter in place for such URLs, so they will still link to where they should.
 


	Q: I have found an issue with the new forum. Can I report it? 
	A: Sure. Send a PM to one of the forum administrators (darkdreamingdan, jhxp or Jusonex) and describe the problem you have found. Make sure you provide all the details or steps to reproduce your issue, where applicable.
 


	 
	We would like to thank Audifire and the mta-sa.org team for donating the forum software license to us. And naturally, you can not forget about darkdreamingdan and Jusonex, our team members who had both put a tremendous amount of effort in preparing and performing the forum maintenance and migration. Awesome job, guys.
 


	 
	Did you like the change? Please let us know in the comments!
 


	See you next time.

			Hi people!
	 

	
		Same drill as usual. The year is nearing to an end, so here is a freshly baked summary post for you. Read on and learn about all the interesting things that happened in the MTA community in 2021.
	 

	
		 
	 

	
		2021 in Recap
	 

	
		
			Early this year, we have restructured our Moderation team a bit by adding the Specializations divisions (such as: Management, Tech and Infrastructure, Social Media). The aim of this was to refine extra talents of our Moderators and put them to a better use. 
			 
		
		
			As one of the results of that, the Management division has introduced a new way for more-involved-but-not-quite-there-yet MTA supporters to contribute - a Helper role. Curious about what it is? Check out the post by Tut. 
			 
		
		
			At the end of July, our developer and designer, Patrik, has revived the live streaming idea a bit and played some MTA:SA on our Twitch channel. He focused on visiting various servers ran by the community. In case you have missed it, you can check the stream capture here: 
			 
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2KcspT0F0A 
			 
		
		
			There were a few recurring requests that you guys have kept asking us about over the years. One of them was to release the mobile version of MTA:SA - apologies, but unfortunately that is still not going to happen . But another request was to make it possible to buy some official MTA merchandise. And guess what - we have listened to you on that one! Patrik has prepared some neat designs and we have put them for sale - although please keep in mind, we do not make any profits of these sales. Want to see the goods? Check them out here: https://multitheftauto.myspreadshop.net/all 
			 
		
		
			Not that long ago, in early October, we have released Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.9. This release was focused on wrapping up the contributions made to the mod so far and put them in a single package for your convenience. 
			 
		
		
			Same month, Rockstar Games has announced an upcoming release of "Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition", a remake/remaster of the original 3D era GTA trilogy (GTA3, GTA:VC and GTA:SA). Not only was it a sudden announcement, but also the release was coming really soon. 
			 
		
		
			The remastered games were released, but received mixed reactions from gamers and reviewers. Technical-wise, they are a feat, as games were remade in a different and well-established game engine and are available for multiple platforms. Sadly, the same could not be said about the actual quality of these games as it was inconsistent. Hopefully, the improvements planned by Rockstar will bring them up to the quality they deserve. 
			 
			It is important to note that MTA mods (GTA3:MTA, MTA:VC and MTA:SA) do not work with the remastered games from the GTA: The Trilogy. 
			 
			We currently have no plans of making them compatible, as it would require an insane amount of effort, considering the technical differences between the original games and their remastered equivalents. 
			 
		
		
			Lately, our Development and Infrastructure divisions have been working on improving the reliability and performance of our web services. You may have noticed that for instance, our forums have been running faster - it is all a result of CiBeR's hard work. 
			 
		
		
			One of our distinguished community members, Haxardous, has prepared a list of interesting MTA:SA servers. If you are looking for a new MTA:SA server to play on, then you might want to check out one of his recommendations. You can find them here. 
			 
		
		
			ModDB has recently featured all of the mods that won the "Mod of the Year" award in the last 20 years. We had won this award ten years ago, so naturally we are on the list too!

		Still looking good.
	 

	
		 
	 

	
		On a side note, our community on Discord keeps growing. We went from 20k users last year to nearly 40k this year. Our presence on social media (Twitter, YouTube, Twitch, Facebook and Reddit) is improving too - thanks to work done by Patrik and the Social Media division.

		Enjoy the holidays and hope to see you back in the next year!

			Hi guys
 


	@fastman92 has recently engaged with us in order to get his limit adjuster implemented into MTA.  Obviously, there are a number of complexities involved in implementing this, and we need to make some important design decisions to achieve this.
 


	So, why do you want to use a Limit Adjuster tool?
 


	Some things I'm hoping to learn:
 


		Are you trying to play MTA with a modified version of GTASA? Do you want the limit adjuster to play mods like GTA:Underground?
	
	
		Are you trying to use Limit Adjusters with MTA's own Lua engine* functions? (e.g. engineLoadDFF)
	
	
		Anything else?
	

	Any feedback would be incredibly beneficial to the team going forward.
 


	Cheers
 


	Dan

			Hello. This is my new custom window system with widgets. 
 


	Just rewrited window system, including this custom GUI widgets:
 


	- Scroll Panes
 


	- Buttons (+ buttons with images)
 


	- Progress Bars (automatic checking for vertical or horizontal using its size, square is horizontal)
 


	- Scroll Bars (same as progress bars)
 


	- Custom Themed Edit Boxes, Memo Boxes, new widget - Number Boxes (support mouse scrolling)
 


	- Check Boxes
 


	- Combo Boxes
 


	- Tab Panel with tabs
 


	- Labels
 


	- Dialog Boxes
 


	- Tooltips
 


	- Loading Circles
 


	- Table Views (Grid Lists) 
 


	Here I've just used only OOP coding style, just copy this one lua file in your projects, and start this resource automatically, because this file getting directories from main resourcename, and using files without copying.

			Summer is over, but fear not, we have got a new release for you - Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.5!
	 

	
		This release is focused on bugfixes (most notably, some popular crashes were fixed with help from @Dutchman101 - eg. this one, code cleanups and under-the-hood improvements for developers (migration to a Docker-based environment and support for VS2017 and GCC-6). It may look like it is not much of an update, but the amount of such smaller changes should be a good incentive to update.
	 

	
		In other news, we have enabled some additional forum account security features for your convenience - namely a possibility to set a security question(s) for the account and support for Authy and Google Authenticator two-factor authentication. You can enable them in your Account Security settings.

			Hi there.
	 

	
		The Winter Holidays are here, so as usual we have got a new recap and status update post for you. Here is the summary of what has happened this year.
	 

	
		 
	 

	
		? 2018 in Recap
	 

	
			
				We made efforts towards the new release through the first half of the year, so there was not much to talk about. There was an incompatibility issue with the 360 Total Security software which we advised you about and later in the year, there was a similar issue with McAfee.
			 
		
		
			Late July, we have asked you about your thoughts about refreshing the community.multitheftauto.com portal. We have received some interesting feedback from you and we are still thinking about ways of implementing it, while considering our current resources.
		
		
			
				Also in July, we have migrated our bug tracking services to GitHub Issues, making it easier to track specific issues and link them to GitHub commits and pull requests. This has also allowed us to clean up our bug tracker - the old system had nearly 8000 tracked issues, some of which were 13 years old or so.
			 
		
		
			
				On 7th of September, we have released Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.6. This release added support for custom IFP animations among other things, like fixing the input and FPS lag reported by some of our users.
			 
		
		
			
				Then a few days later, we have advised you to upgrade your MTA:SA servers to the latest version due to a server crash exploit that was discovered. There were some additional issues with this hotfix that were spotted later, but they have been all fixed within few days. If you have not yet upgraded your servers though, we still urge you to do so.

					Percentage of players using that version or series as of 24th of December, 2018
				
			
					1.6.0 (alpha)
				
				
					0.05%
				
			
					1.5.6
				
				
					97.20%
				
			
					1.5.5
				
				
					2.00%
				
			
					1.5.4 (and older)
				
				
					0.40%
				
			
					
						1.4.x
					 
				
				
					
						0.20%
					 
				
			
					1.3.x
				
				
					0.15%
				
			
		Similar to last year, two of our most recent releases are used by over 99% of our player base. It means that there is little fragmentation between our releases and that players in general upgrade to the newest release once it is available. Also, there seems to be some interest in the newest alpha version as well - that is nice too.
	 

	
		 
	 

	
		? Status updates
	 

	
		Community-wise, our Discord has expanded this year - currently we have got 10 language-specific sections available for you there, as well as the active as usual English ones. We have also opened a new forum section recently to keep appeals for global game bans in one place. Over the next few weeks we intend to refresh our forum rules to better suit the current forum needs.
	 

	
		As for mod's development, we will continue working on the next release. We are thinking of integrating a new version of the client installer to reduce amount of issues encountered when installing MTA:SA (as well as to make it easier to investigate the remaining ones). We will also consider adding new features provided by our community members, such as editing collisions and adjusting surface properties by CrosRoad95.
	 

	
		 
	 

	
		That's it for now. ?âHappy Holidays and all the best to you in 2019! ?

			Introduction
 


	Modding is a term used when modifying components, files and what not, in this particular case modifying game installation files in order to achieve unique results not seen in the vanilla game. GTA:SA is 3D era, where modding the game requires special 3D packages. Older games such as GTA:II uses a 2D engine, which means that modding the game was commonly done with image editing applications. We will cover some aspects of modding game textures and models.
 


	This guide intends on introducing those inexperienced with modding and 3D as a whole, on how to obtain 3D software and their recommended tools. It also introduces ways to import and export models, basic workflows for 3ds Max, texturing and creating models.

	3D packages, helpful tools and how to obtain them
 


	There are various applications being used for modding. Although some has more tools available, there really isn't one that tops the others. In this section there'll be lists of a few 3D packages and tools used for modding.
 


	3ds Max, arguably the most used program with the greatest amount of third-party plugins and scripts for various games. For GTA:SA, this program is favored by many modders due to it having 3rd party scripts for dealing with animations, collisions, lighting, modeling etcetera. There isn't much that 3ds Max can't, that other programs can, when it comes to GTA:SA modding. Although this can be expensive to run on a longer term, there are education licenses available which last for 3 years. These do not allow commercial use, and is marked purely as "educational use only". 
	View more. 
	Kam's (vanilla) max scripts, the first official script package for modding GTA:SA with 3ds Max. After the release of his scripts, a lot of others has developed scripts of their own, some of which are more optimized and less prone to issues. Even despite Kam's scripts having overseen issues, it is still to this day widely used for tasks such as, but not limited to; IPL map generation and import, collisions, animations, characters, vehicles, environment modeling. 
	View more. 
	Kam's (2018) max scripts, a modified version of Kam's vanilla scripts for 3ds Max. Notable features that were added are; DK22pac's Normal map plugin support, reflection map support for environment models, 2dfx panel for lights such as aircraft lights or street lamps. 
	View more. 
	The Hero's RW importer/exporter, a modern plugin that works extremely well with vehicles and environment models. Due to its simplified layout it is very easy to get used to. It's far recommended to use for vehicle model import/export due to its quality handling and materials, which are based on RW formats (renderware, the engine GTA:SA runs off). With the plugin using different model material formats from Kam's, it comes with a maxscript to convert scene materials from GTA_MTL to RW_MTL and vice versa, if needed by the modeler. 
	View more. 
	Deniska's max scripts, a pack for various types of GTA:SA modding, some features are obsolete for MTA users due to IPL and IDE modification required. Although, the pack does come with a few tools that may be useful to MTA modders, such as prelight tools to set the vertex colors and illumination to fixed values. 
	View more. 
	DexX's 2dfx export script, a standalone 3ds Max script that exports Omni and Dummy informations to .sae file formats, to then be added to the .dff using RW analyzer. With this script it's possible to integrate lights and particles into custom models, e.g flashing aircraft lights, street lights, fire and smoke, etcetera. With the release of Kam's 2018 scripts, this script is used less as using Kam's may be less work for some cases. 
	View more. 
	Blender 3D, a freeware (yes, completely free, no paid watermarks or any limitations), not as favored by modders throughout the years until recently, where a developer has released his script 'DragonFF' on GTAforums. Although it is WIP, modders has already binned 3ds Max and moved permanently to Blender. Although Blender is free, it actually combines several programs into one, allowing a Blender user to sculpt, paint, do lighting, professional rendering and modeling in one. A recent update in 2019 changes the RMB selection to LMB and UI among other things, making for a potential alternative to 3ds Max. 
	View more (Blender). 
	View more (Blender GTA script) 
	Zmodeler, not as commonly used as the aforementioned programs, although it is being used very frequently by modders in various games, most notably for GTA:games. It does not have support for skinned characters, although it is being commonly used for vehicles, and sometimes environment modeling as well. This is a fairly inexpensive solution, but lacks tools for more broad modding. 
	View more. 
	Sketchup, a 3D application that focuses on architecture. For modding, it is a rather uncommon, though has a free and paid version and can be used for seemingly OK modeling. It does not have access to any 3rd party scripts for GTA:SA, hence its only use is modeling and then exporting model files to then import into 3ds Max or Blender. 
	View more. 
	Photoshop, mainly used for graphic design, but can also produce 3D models, video, GIF and textures for assets. Photoshop is the most favored by modders in regards to working with textures e.g paintjobs and retexturing. Although there are alternative image editors in the market, Photoshop definitely hits the top in terms of usable scripts (user-customized scripts as well) and ease of workflow. 
	View more. 
	DFF Viewer, a 3D graphics engine that is used for visualising GTA:SA models and supports .DFF and .TGA formats. Only single dff's can be loaded at a time. Though this is rarely used by those who has access to 3ds Max and Blender, it is commonly used for troubleshooting/testing work that involves retexturing a model e.g changing the clothing textures of a character. This program is entirely free and available from various GTA modding sites. 
	View more. 
	TXD Workshop, a texture dictionary editor that has been around for years, only since recent years to be succeeded by Magic TXD. Though TXD Workshop may not be the best for setting up TXD files, it has a built-in IMG archive editor, allowing one to browse all of the contents of gta3.img. 
	View more. 
	MagicTXD, a new texture dictionary editor with features for mass exporting .TXD contents from folders into image subfolders, texture compression, mipmaps, resizing textures etcetera. This is broadly used for .txd files and almost took over TXD workshop when it comes to working with texture dictionaries. 
	View more. 
	RW Analyze, a multi-use program with notable features being; ability to lock/unlock game files, add data to game models e.g 2dfx and vertex colors information extracted from other DFF files. 
	View more. 
	 
 


	 
 


	Extracting game assets
 


	In order to start modding GTA, access to the files is required. The files in question are commonly found in parent files that require some sort of program to open. In this case, TXD Workshop or any IMG editor and optionally Magic TXD for later on will work just fine. The below steps shows one way to extract all models and their texture dictionaries.
 


	For IMG editors (e.g Alci's IMG Editor): 
 


	
		Open the editor. Under File, select Open. Find gta3.IMG stored in GTA SA directory\models.
	
	
		Highlight the first file in the list, then scroll down to the very bottom and SHIFT+LMB click the file on the bottom. This highlights every file in GTA3.IMG.
	
	
		Right click the list of files and select Export. On the popup window, find and select, or create a new folder on desktop called GTA SA ASSETS. Click enter to proceed. 
		((For cases where specific files are wanted, use the search field to find the necessary files and export them individually))
	



	For TXD Workshop users:
 


	
		Open TXD Workshop. In the toolbar it says Open IMG. Click this, then find and select gta3.IMG stored in GTA SA directory\models.
	
	
		Highlight the first file in the list, then scroll down to the very bottom and SHIFT+LMB click the file on the bottom. This highlights every file in GTA3.IMG.
	
	
		Right click the list of files, select Extract. On the window, find and select, or create a new folder on desktop called GTA SA ASSETS. Click enter to proceed. 
		((For cases where specific files are wanted, use the search field to find the necessary files))
	



	Now the folder GTA SA ASSETS contains nearly every .dff, .col, .txd and so on used by the game. Assuming one would like having all of the textures in PNG, DDS, TGA or any other common image format, they may follow the below steps using Magic TXD.
 


	
		Inside GTA SA ASSETS create a new folder named IMAGES.
	
	
		Open any .txd file found in GTA SA ASSETS using Magic TXD. 
	
	
		Navigate to the toolbar. On Tools, click Mass export. Export settings are as following.
	



	
 


	Game root = root folder containing TXD's 
	Output root = folder where images goes 
	Image format = self explanatory 
	With texture names only = exports images directly to folder and duplicate named ones gets replaced by one another 
	Pre-pended with TXD name = exports images with TXD prefix 
	In separate folders = makes new folder(s) for every TXD's contents
 


	Hit export. This process may take some time. 
	Note that this process is the same for other .IMG archives such as player.img. There are also .txd and .dff files elsewhere, such as \models\generic\generic.txd, which is the vehicle shared texture dictionary file.
 


	 
 


	How each type of game model works
 


	Models used on GTA SA uses different rendering techniques and data hierarchy than others. This section will introduce the features that some models has that others don't.
 


	Vehicles:
 


	Vehicle model components utilises hierarchies, where each component is linked to a dummy (helper) and each dummy is linked to parent dummies e.g chassis_dummy, for them to be registered in the hierarchy. In order for vehicles to not look flat or cartoon, a few steps are made in the model;
 


	Diffuse material is given a grunge texture or AO map, this helps telling the depth of the vehicle as well as giving it a feel of realism, so it isn't just clean. 
	A specular lighting image is applied to the vehicle surface material, giving it a fake shine when looking from certain angles. If the vehicle has hard edges (smoothing), this image can increase the visibility of the normals, retaining its original look rather than being flat without visible difference in geometry. 
	An environment (ENV) map is applied to the vehicle surface material, producing a fake reflection that is animated horizontally as the vehicle travels.
 


	Vehicles also has a lot of hardcoded features such as headlights, brake lights, emissive lights, taxi/aircraft lights, rotatable components and dynamic collisions for special vehicles like Forklift. Vehicles are also the only dff models that uses baked collisions, which means they are stored in the .dff itself.  
	 
	Below is a detailed hierarchy used for cars, and special components used by a number of vehicles (click the spoiler).
 




	 
	Skin characters:
 


	Ped skin characters uses bones (dummy objects) that are connected to each other and linked to the character model. These bones are not visible in-game. In order for the bones to know what part of the 3D model they're responsible for, the skin needs to be rigged. Character rigging for GTA:SA is done by applying weigh on vertices. Using heatmap display, colors go through blue-red, low-high respectively. Values go from 0 to 100. If the value is 0, it means that the vertex is not used for any bone. This can cause issues. If the value is &lt; 100, it means that the vertex is used for multiple bones. This results in smooth animations ingame, as the 3D model transitions smoothly through each bone. If the value is 100, it means that the vertex is only responsible for one bone. Skin rigging is generally something that is being avoided by modelers and makes Skin modeling the most difficult on GTA. 
	Bones are as shown:
 


	          
 


	 
 


	CJ character:
 


	Carl Johnson's 3D model is split into several pieces in order to be compatible with the clothing script used to let the player customize CJ. These models uses a function known as multiclump to support 3 meshes per dff; normal, ripped and fat. This is for CJ's health stats to physically show in-game. Other than multiclump and additional bones, modding CJ skin is essentially the same as any other ped skin.
 


	Map environment:
 


	World objects .dff contains only single models, though they do support omni and dummy objects for 2d effects. These types of models uses Vertex Colors/Face Colors. This requires the modeler to paint colors onto the model which is then stored in the vertex colors channel (daytime) and vertex illumination channel (nighttime).
 


	Although uncommonly used by R*, these models do support reflection maps like vehicles use. Goldfish's modified version of Kam's scripts is excellent for exporting with reflection maps. GTA SA utilises multiple collision archives (.col) for every IPL district, being responsible for all of the world objects' collisions. However, on MTA, collision archives are not supported, so custom collision files are single models per .col. Not every object uses collisions though, some merely has their bounding space. These objects can not be selected with MTA map editor, thus requires additional scripting or modding.
 


	 
	 
 


	Limitations - MTA vs GTA
 


	Speaking of native support, MTA currently is behind in several places. Notable features that aren't available on MTA, but on GTA are as following.
 


	
		Item Placement (IPL) - another type of mapping file, but contains a lot more functions such as zones for real-time reflections as seen in interiors.
	
	
		Item definition (IDE) - a file used to but not exclusively, define settings for models, enabling alpha flags, disabling backface cull, enable breakable effect and much more.
	
	
		Limit adjuster - a rework of the game that allows for adding more ID's and bypass common limits. This however is being developed by one of MTA's contributors.
	



	There are various limitations such as polys per model, max dimensions for models and collisions, (very) strict size limits for collisions and CPU usage that can easily cause issues for modders. Not to mention the majority of the game data files which most MTA servers likes to force original, else the player won't be able to connect. These limits all has potential solutions being developed as with the limit adjuster.
 


	 
	 
 


	Working with 3ds Max
 


	As described above, 3ds Max is without a doubt the most common program for GTA modding. It's also used by professionals within architecture and visualisation and film industry. What's amazing about this program is that whatever is created in 3ds Max can ultimately be added to the game. A modeler made a square - it can get added right away, no adjustments required. That's the charm of 3ds Max. There's no need for additional tools to process the model for it to be compatible with GTA. It is also the primary program that Rockstar's developers used for creating the environment in GTA:SA.
 


	At a first glance, the program may seem rather intimidating. The main functions of the program that a beginner should be aware of are listed below.
 


	
 


	Shows the default home screen with 4 viewports. Left, Top, Front and Perspective. The 3 side ones are Orthographic viewports while Perspective is in regular mode. It is also the most common one to use. Highlighting a viewport and pressing (left)ALT W will full screen the viewport.
 


	In order to rotate camera view, the user must click and drag the square in the upper right corner. Its face also tells which side the camera is viewing e.g Top. 
	If one wishes to see viewport statistics such as polygons per model, vertex amount etc., clicking: 
	[ + ] icon on the upper left side &gt; Configure Viewport &gt; Statistics &gt; Total + Selection &gt; Apply &gt; Clicking 7 on keyboard shows the statistics. This feature is extremely useful for modelers who are limited in polygons per model, or simply wants to see how many polys a car is.
 


	Common keyboard shortcuts 
	F1: Opens Autodesk help section in new browser tab 
	F2: Displays blue overlay on models 
	F3: Displays models in wireframe 
	F4: Displays edges on models 
	F10: Opens render setup 
	9: Shows viewport statistics 
	Q: Select objects 
	W: Select and move 
	E: Rotate 
	R: Select and (mode) scale 
	U: Orthographic viewport mode 
	P: Perspective viewport mode 
	A: Toggle angle snap 
	S: Enable snap 
	D: Disable viewport 
	G: Enable/disable grid 
	J: Display bounding edges 
	LALT X: Xray mode for model 
	Ctrl Z: Undo action 
	Ctrl Y: Redo action
 


	 
 


	In a heavy program like 3ds Max, being able to change preferences to one's likings is important. Do so by going to Customize &gt; Preferences. Performance, file settings and such can all be configured in there. 
	For GTA:SA modding, knowing how to subdivide and add geometry to existing GTA models is very important. Below is a list with actions that may come in handy.
 


	No-brainer: Editable Mesh is inferior to Editable Poly. Use Poly, poly, poly, poly... 
	Editable mesh modeling
 


	Vertex selection mode 
	Edit Geometry section 
	Attach: attaches another model in the scene to the selected mesh 
	Chamfer: chamfer selection of vertices; creates additional geometry 
	Weld: merges vertices together within a specified threshold 
	Surface Properties section 
	Edit Vertex Colors: sets the color and illumination of selected vertices 
	 
	Edge selection mode 
	Edit Geometry section 
	Divide: divides an edge, adding a new vertex where it was divided/split 
	Extrude: create and pull a new face out from existing edges (keyboard shortcut: LSHIFT + LMB-drag) 
	 
	 
	Face selection mode 
	Edit Geometry section 
	Divide: creates a new face 
	Extrude: pulls the select face(s) outwards or inwards and creates new geometry off that 
	Bevel: essentially an Extrude followed by scaling of the face 
	Surface Properties section 
	Flip: flips a face 180 degrees 
	Smoothing groups: defines the smoothing of the model. Autosmooth is in many cases OK, but may not fulfil everyone's expectations 
	 
 


	Editable poly modeling
 


	Vertex selection mode 
	Edit Vertices 
	Connect: selecting 4 verts on a box side and using this function will triangulate the side.  
	 
	Edge selection mode 
	Edit Edges 
	Connect: creates an edge between the selected edges, as in a bridge between two cliff sides (use the 'Settings' to choose between multiple or one edge on creation) 
	 
	Polygon selection mode 
	Edit Polygons 
	Inset: places a new polygon inside the selected, allowing to be scaled 
	Bridge: connects two opposing polygons by creating a bridge between them (can be used for walls and gaps) 
	Edit Geometry 
	Slice Plane: enables the user to create a perfect cut on the model, can be rotated by degrees
 


	 
 


	Rendering scene
 


	Modelers working on projects for companies or friends might want to show what they've accomplished, but a regular screenshot may not suffice. Talking of a screenshot like this:
 


	
 


	Instead, the modeler might want to show the scene with textures. Perhaps more than just textures - lighting? reflections? transparency? - this is where 3D rendering comes into play, and can be done by simply pressing SHIFT + Q on the keyboard. This can also by default use alpha channel. However, the quality could improve. 
	The quality of the render depends on the scene assets (models, materials, lights), the Renderer and its settings. By default, 3ds Max utilises Scanline Renderer. This is not a production quality render, but rather meant for test shots and demos. Though the quality isn't great, it's still possible to produce seemingly interesting renders. The following render took merely 8 seconds. 
	
 


	Using 3ds Max allows modders to bring GTA:SA into modern graphics, easily comparable or even superior to ENB's. It also enables modelers to share visualizations of their models to help the customer understand how it could potentially look for their game. In the above render, a Skylight is used with Scanline Renderer. A very basic render, though interesting and contains lots of depth. In order to replicate this result, below are the steps to follow:
 


	On the Create panel, where one would normally find boxes and spheres, click the toolbar Lights. Where it says Photometric change that to Standard. Click the Skylight and place it in the 3ds Max scene. 
	 
	Settings for Skylight explained 
	Multiplier: intensity of the light 
	Sky color: the color of the light 
	Cast shadows: enable to produce shadows, though this is more of an Ambient Occlusion than actual shadows 
	Rays per sample: quality of the shadow, ideally keep at &lt;5 for tests and 15-20 for final shots 
	In the actual render above, a sample of 5 was used, creating grainy shadows but quick render. Backface culling was enabled to avoid slowing down the render time.
 


	Skylight is great light source and is generally used to illuminate an entire scene and not particular models. In the same Lights tab, one may find use of Omni or Free lights, which both works great. These are great point lights, which as opposed to skylight, are able to illuminate parts of the scene e.g acting as street lights.
 


	 
 


	Modifiers 
	When modeling, modifiers can come in use and save the modeler a lot of time. The following modifiers are highly suggested for beginners to know about. 
	Bend: bends the model, effect depends on the differences in the geometry 
	Mirror: copies the mesh and mirrors it on the other side, commonly used for vehicles using symmetrical geometry 
	Smooth: generates and applies smoothing to the model, generally the lower values makes for higher file sizes 
	Symmetry: essentially the same modifier as 'Mirror' 
	Turbosmooth: Smoothens the mesh, adding geometry, uses iterations 
	Unwrap UVW: advanced UV editing, commonly used for preparing textures for models like characters and game assets 
	UVW map: basic UV editing, X/Y/Z projection mapping as well as spherical, box and planar mapping 
	Vertexpaint: allows for painting colors onto vertices and faces, these colors are rendered during either ingame or night time 
	 
	 
 


	Texturing a game-ready cube
 


	Modeling has to start somewhere. Using standard 3D primitives is a good place to start. For the purpose of this guide, a Cube will be created in 3ds Max and textured in Paint.net, a free image editing software. 
 


	Video tutorial:
 


	
		
	



	To start off, navigate to 3ds Max's Create tab on the right hand side panel, as shown below. 
	      
	Shows the Create tab on the  panel. For this guide, click on Box (Cube). Use LMB and click and drag the mouse in the viewport to create the cube.
 


	Now that the Cube primitive is spawned in the viewport, on the same panel that it was created from, go to Modify tab and set its dimension parameters to 5,0, 5,0, 5,0 and 1 segment for all 3. Convert the model to Editable Poly by right clicking it in the Viewport &gt; Convert to &gt; Editable Poly. 
	Go into Polygon selection mode and scroll down until the following buttons are visible: 
	 
	With viewport selected, on the keyboard press `CTRL A` to select all faces on the cube. Now, where it says `Color`, click the bar and on `Value` set it to 100, then do the same for `Illumination` but value at 35. What this does is it sets the vertex colors so that the model won't be overexposed during day/night time.
 


	Exit polygon selection mode and on Modifier List, click that and find Unwrap UVW. This applies a modifier stacked on top of the Editable Poly mesh. Under Edit UVs click Open UV Editor. This allows the user to make changes to the UV coordinates which tells the model how textures are projected onto the model. 
	On the editor, ensure that Polygon selection is enabled. While in the UV editor, press `CTRL A` to select all UV islands. On the top of the editor click Mapping, then Unfold Mapping.... Keep it as Walk to closest face and enable Normalize Clusters. Click OK. 
	 
	The result should remind the user of how a simple cardboard box in real life looks when it's yet to be folded into a box.
 


	With the model unwrapped, on the toolbar on the UV editor, click Tools &gt; Render UVW Template. The export settings below are ideal for this particular task. If one wishes to know exact dimensions of each square, enable Seam Edges. After exporting, on the modifier stack, press Collapse to. This saves the new UV's.
 


	
 


	The width and height should be on a 1:1 ratio to avoid stretching issues. 1024x1024 is more than enough. 
	On the rendered image window, click the Save button and find a location to save it in, name it Cube_unwrapped and use Alpha channel (optionally). Now open Paint.net and insert the image. Once happy with the result, export as cube_diffuse.
 


	 
	Diffuse map generated with the help of a UVW template.
 


	 
	In order to apply the texture on the model, simply drag and drop the image from file browser onto the model in the Viewport. Although the example above is not textured properly in regards to rotations, it shows what can be done by using UVW templates, and how easy it really is to produce textures for models made from scratch. 
	The model can be directly exported as DFF. Materials are not required to be GTA or RW, they can be standard and still show ingame. Some exporters wants the model in Editable Mesh however, so converting it may be required.
 


	 
 


	Thanks for reading this guide, we hope it helps and we wish you the best of luck with modelling!

			Hi.
	 

	
		We hope that all of you are safe and healthy. The year of 2020 is finally coming to an end, so here is our traditional "A year in Recap" post for you. Below you can find the summary of what has happened during this year and a handful of other things that might be interesting to you.
	 

	
		 
	 

	
		?ï¸ 2020 in Recap
	 

	
		Surely, it is hard to mention this year without mentioning the COVID-19 pandemic. Many lives were lost and millions of people had to deal (and still cope) with the consequences of the disease. The pandemic had locked many of us down in our homes and forced us to change our lifestyles.
	 

	
		
			These were the times when MTA:SA had seen the biggest number of players ever recorded. The achieved popularity growth still seems to be present even today, when you compare this year's numbers to the ones from a year before. 
			 
		
		
			April has marked the third anniversary of the opening of our Discord and a lot of things have changed since then. We have introduced more regional channels and made it easier to contact our team if you had an important matter to discuss. We have also made it easier for new users to check and accept our Discord Rules in their language. Our server has over 15.000 members nowadays (even after a little miss-click on the Purge users button during the year ?) and we are still working towards getting even more members. 
			 
		
		
			Some work has been done on reviving the AMX Compatibility Layer module. It can be used for running the existing PAWN gamemodes, filterscripts and plugins in MTA:SA. There is a public beta build for the Windows server if you would like to try it out. The module is open source - so you are more than welcome to contribute to it too. 
			 
		
		
			We have released Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.8 in October. The changes in this release were mostly community contributions, improvements and bugfixes. It took us more time than usual to publish it, as nearly 407 days have passed since the last release. We hope that it was a polished enough build to be worthy of the wait. 
			 
		
		
			Aside of that, we have been experimenting with doing some MTA:SA related streaming on our Twitch channel for a while. Woovie has done an excellent job on these streams and covered a bunch of topics, such as the community servers and gamemodes reviews, Lua scripting and doing code reviews and QA. If you have not seen them, we have put some of them on our YouTube channel. 
			 
		
		
			Our Forums were overhauled this year. In addition to that, one of our community members has recently made a brief post about how the Forums have changed over the years. It is nice to see that there are people out there who are interested in the historical side of things too.

		The numbers are slightly bigger than in the last year. Some of the records were not beaten, but were a really close call. For example, nearly 800 000 unique players had played this year in April! And our recent concurrent unique players peaks are bigger than our last year's records for that.
	 

	
		How does this compare to modern games, you may ask? You can check it yourself by visiting the Steam Stats page. Powerhouses like GTA V, CS:GO, PUBG and Cyberpunk 2077 have much higher peak players numbers, but we are surely close to some of the other well-known games - for instance Civilization VI, Terraria, Euro Truck Simulator 2 or Garry's Mod. We are even surpassing the recent player counts of games, such as Left 4 Dead 2, Europa Universalis IV or Borderlands 3 (at least on Steam).

		The latest versions are the most popular ones so the version fragmentation is not much of a problem.
	 

	
		 
	 

	
		? Status updates
	 

	
		In terms of the mod development, we have been mostly monitoring the situation after the recent release for now. We have also received some nice contributions from the community developers, like the work done by fastman92 to improve MTA:SA's compatibility with fastman92 limit adjuster. Patrik has been putting a lot of effort into designing the new Community site - we would love to see those designs replace the old site one day.
	 

	
		Team-wise, we are in process of doing major inner changes in order to improve the transparency and the quality of our work. These changes will be hard to notice at first, as they are strictly related to our Team's organization and policies (they will especially affect the Moderators Team). After a while though, you might be able to see their effects for yourself as well.
	 

	
		 
	 

	
		 
	 

	
		That's it for now. 
		 
		? ? Happy Holidays and best wishes to all of you! Let's hope that 2021 will be better than 2020. ?ï¸ ?

			Hey. After two years of scripting i've decided to shared a bit of my knowledge with community, which i've learnt - special thanks goes to @IIYAMA for teaching me trigger and tables related stuff. Therefore i present you:
 


	



	Custom element data
 


	It is data system based on Lua tables and trigger(Server)(Client)Event, which was created and released back in 2020, over few months received a significant updates which introduced useful client-side features and not-so complex logic to fully control data flow through server-side. I do plan to actively develop it, mainly in improving performance which is already great, but also introducing new features.
 


	



	But before going forward...
 


	Let's do some comparision to element data. Color of divbox explains whether is a pro, con, or neutral difference.
 


	
		Tables are resource dependent, that means you cannot get table and it's contents in other resource without special steps (using exports), while
	 



	
		Element data is resource independent, it's possible to get data from any resource.
	 



	
		Restarting resource causes table to lost stored data, while
	 



	
		Element data keeps it, until element gets destroyed.
	 



	
		Tables are considerably faster, while
	 



	
		Element data is slower.
	 



	After acknowledging differences you might say that advantage is taken by element data system because of resource independency, but in later part of tutorial i will point out and describe two scripted features in this data system (they aren't implemented in element data) which are important during sending anything to players, afromentioned features are heavily affecting both client and server performance.

	Latest version is available on GitHub.
 


	



	Syntax
 


	Client:

		mixed getElementsByKey(string pKey, mixed pValue, string pType, bool pMultipleResults)
	 

	
		bool setCustomData(mixed pElement, string pKey, mixed pValue, string pType, mixed pEvent, mixed pSyncer)
	 

	
		bool addDataHandler(mixed pElementTypes, mixed pTypes, mixed pKeys, function pFunction, mixed pEvent)
	 



	 
	Server:

		bool forceBatchDataSync(mixed pQueue, mixed pType)
	 



	



	Function acceptable types of data, returns and behaviours:
 


	Client:
 


	
		mixed getCustomData(mixed pElement, mixed pKey, string pType)
	 

	
		
	

	
		pElement: element or a string which holds data pack 
		pKey: string which holds data under certain name or nil 
		pType: string which defines data type, can be "local", "synced" or "private"
	 

	
		
	

	
		nil: on failure, or when certain key it's not existing 
		table: with all data, on success, when pKey is equal to nil 
		anything else: on success, this can be a string, number, table, bool
	 

	
		
	

	
		This function is used for retrieving data stored under element, you can retrieve certain key or whole data.
	 



	
		mixed getElementsByKey(string pKey, mixed pValue, string pType, bool pMultipleResults)
	 

	
		
	

	
		pKey: string, which defines a key used by element 
		pValue: string, bool, number, userdata in case if you want filter by certain value, or false/nil if you don't need value to be matching 
		pType: string, which defines data types, can be "local", "synced" or "private" 
		pMultipleResults: bool, which decides if you want get more than one element using certain data, true for multiple elements, false for single element
	 

	
		
	

	
		false: on failure 
		table: empty on failure, and containing element(s) on success - only if pMultipleResults is enabled 
		element: on success
	 

	
		
	

	
		This function allows you to get a element(s) which contains certain data key, if required you can enable matching key to specified value.
	 



	
		bool setCustomData(mixed pElement, string pKey, mixed pValue, string pType, mixed pEvent, mixed pSyncer)
	 

	
		
	

	
		pElement: element or string, which you wish to set data 
		pKey: string, which defines a key used by element 
		pValue: string, boolean, number, userdata or table which will be set as key value 
		pType: string, which defines type of data, can be "local", "synced" or "private"

		pSyncer: element or false/nil, responsible for data syncing
	 

	
		
	

	
		false: on failure 
		true: on success
	 

	
		
	

	
		This function allows you to set a data for element, with certain key, value and data type on client-side with some extras. It doesn't force sync due of security reasons.
	 



	Server:
 


	
		mixed getCustomData(mixed pElement, string pKey, string pType, element pRequester)
	 

	
		
	

	
		pElement: element or a string which holds data pack 
		pKey: string which holds data under certain name or nil 
		pType: string which defines data type, can be "local", "synced" or "private" 
		pRequester: player or nil/false, which requests data - ignored when pType isn't equal to "private"
	 

	
		
	

	
		nil: on failure, or when certain key it's not existing 
		table: with all data, on success, when pKey is equal to nil

		false: on failure 
		table: on success/failure, when pMultipleResults is enabled 
		element: on success, when pMultipleResults is disabled
	 

	
		
	

	
		This function allows you to get a element(s) which contains certain data key, if required you can enable matching key to specified value.
	 



	
		bool setCustomData(mixed pElement, string pKey, mixed pValue, string pType, mixed pReceivers, mixed pSyncer, mixed pEvent, mixed pBuffer, int pTimeout)
	 

	
		
	

	
		pElement: element or string, which you wish to set data 
		pKey: string, which defines a key used by element 
		pValue: string, boolean, number, userdata or table which will be set as key value

		pSyncer: element or false/nil, responsible for data syncing 
		pEvent: string or false/nil, defining which server event caused data to change 
		pBuffer: string or false/nil, if string passed it will enable batch or buffer functionality (see below for explanation) 
		pTimeout: integer or false/nil, if it's == -1 then server will use batch, if it's &gt;= 0 server will use buffer, ignored if pBuffer isn't enabled
	 

	
		
	

	
		true: on success 
		false: on failure
	 

	
		
	

	
		This function allows you to set a data for element, with certain key, value and data type with some extras on server-side.
	 



	
		bool forceBatchDataSync(mixed pQueue, mixed pType)
	 

	
		
	

	
		pQueue: string/false/nil, when string is passed server will search for specified queue to sync, otherwise it will select all queues, not dependent on it's name 
		pType: string/false/nil, when string is passed server will search for certain type of queue, can be "synced" or "private", otherwise it will select all queues, not dependent on type
	 

	
		
	

	
		true: on success 
		false: on failure
	 

	
		
	

	
		This function allows you to optimise data flow by collecting pack of data and sending it with merged trigger, further explanations available in later part of tutorial.
	 



	After reading detailed syntax, it's time to move on next topic and understand server-side data validation. Often skipped by majority of scripters, even though it's a very important thing.
 


	



	Server-side data validation
 


	It's a process when server validates data sent from client, if you aren't familiar with it, it might sound difficult, but in reality it isn't. Validation is made in server event function handler, via simple if conditions, it ensures that client sent valid data which later will be used by server. While MTA:SA anticheat is one of strongest ones and you can rely on it in most cases, it is scripter task to make sure that server-side logic is also scripted well, to completely eliminate possibility of harming your server by client sending fake (malicious variant), or incorrect data (default variant). Yes, even default client could be harmful, even unintentionally - let's take for a example ping as a main factor, due of delay between certain player and server, data for player A might have different value than for player B. What to do in that case? Answer is simple, get data value from server.
 


	
		Instead of: 
		Client -&gt; Request data change with player value -&gt; Server -&gt; Process it
	 



	
		Do: 
		Client -&gt; Request data change -&gt; Server -&gt; Check for client variable -&gt; Get value from server -&gt; Process it
	 



	But, what if (MTA) function isn't available server-side? Then you need use client for returning it and sending to server, e.g collision checks. While this might feels insecure you can (and should) always check whether type of data passed is valid. Special Lua function will be irreplaceable here. 
	 
 

local clientData = {}
local typeOfData = type(clientData)

print(typeOfData) -- "table"


	
		You might wonder what is client variable? Shortly, it's a special global variable which is used in server events. This wiki article explains that when we want to receive a player who called the event, we should use client instead of source. Why? Because: 
		 
		Any player with access to runcode/Lua injector can pass another player which might have admin permissions. This will result in executing server code even though it shouldn't happen by default. 
		Aforementioned source might be not an actual player, because you can pass pretty much every element e.g root, resourceRoot.
	 



	Perhaps you already know that nothing is 100% safe? That is accurate sentence, but when it comes to scripted server-side data validation - you can't bypass it, if it's correctly written. Well, probably you could do that, but you'd need to access server itself, however if it'd happen then it's game over. Example of validation is available here, since i do not pass any data from player side, if client then condition with parent check is sufficient.
 


	Is there anything else you can do to protect your server more?
 


	Actually yes. Since trigger(Client)ServerEvent is a function which calls a counter-side functions (and pass data to it) it's affecting traffic and CPU. It should be well maintained (element data isn't exception). If you do not understand events then feel free to check IIYAMA's events tutorial, while he explains basics i will be expanding this by showing how you can reduce calls and optimise passing data between sides, because triggers are main component of my data system. We'll be moving step by step from easier to a bit harder topics, here comes our first step.
 


	



	Client-side delays
 


	As i mentioned before that triggers should be well maintained, we should add some delay for client-side, which will be a obstacle for someone, who'd try to spam server with triggerServerEvent calls. It's easily achievable with getTickCount function. 
	 
 

--[[
/***************************************************
	Client
***************************************************\
]]

local dataToPass = "string" -- data we want pass to server
local lastTriggerCall = getTickCount() -- store last trigger call
local delayValue = 500 -- ms

function triggerEventByCommand()
	if getTickCount() - lastTriggerCall &gt;= delayValue then -- if delay has passed
		triggerServerEvent("onServerEvent", localPlayer, dataToPass) -- trigger server event
		lastTriggerCall = getTickCount() -- update last trigger call
	end
end
addCommandHandler("trigger", triggerEventByCommand)

--[[
/***************************************************
	Server
***************************************************\
]]

function onServerEvent(pData)
	if client then -- check whether client exists (just for sake)
		local isString = type(pData) == "string" -- make sure that is string

		if isString then -- if so
			local validLength = #pData &lt;= 4 -- check whether is less or equal to 4 chars

			if validLength then -- if so
				print("The checks have passed... Processing code.")
			end
		end
	end
end
addEvent("onServerEvent", true)
addEventHandler("onServerEvent", root, onServerEvent)


	You can also implement same delay checks on server-side, but i believe that client-side should be sufficient.
 


	



	Selecting lowest possible source element for trigger
 


	Probably many of you (including myself), have passed root or resourceRoot as a 2-nd/3-rd argument in function:
 


	
		triggerServerEvent ( string event, element theElement, [arguments...] )
	 



	
		triggerClientEvent ( [ table/element sendTo = getRootElement(), ] string name, element sourceElement [, arguments... ] )
	 



	That shouldn't be done, unless you know what you are doing. Because of CPU impact which wiki states on client and server variation. Most of people (once again, including myself) misunderstood this note. Which is not about attaching custom events to root, but about passing it to trigger itself. While resourceRoot is lower than root in element tree, you should use localPlayer instead - on client-side. When it comes to server-side you can also use same player which triggered certain event, as for example this is handled similarly in server-side part of custom data. But i do also check if sourceElement (pSyncer) is actual element to avoid warnings. We could say that attachedTo is some kind of filter which checks if sourceElement which triggered certain event is allowed (depending on it's position in element tree) to process the function. But you've should already know that if you read events tutorial.
 


	
		addEventHandler ( string eventName, element attachedTo, function handlerFunction [, bool propagate = true, string priority = "normal" ] )
	 



	



	Optimising data flow
 


	First and foremost my favourite way - batching. What is it, why and when you should use it? Batching is a process when you place data in certain queue, this data however isn't synced instantly, it's stored at server-side in additional table, till force sync will be called (forceBatchDataSync). This is different scenario when we compare it to element data, while custom data with batching enabled sends pack of data in 1 trigger (1 queue = 1 trigger), element data sends each (!) data separately. In other words, you can do x100 setCustomData and they will be sent with 1 trigger, while x100 setElementData waste a lot of traffic and CPU by doing that separately. Generally you should use it always when you set more than one data.
 


	Practical example, setting data upon spawning vehicle: 
	 
 

local dataTable = {{"Data 1", "Value 1"}, {"Data 2", "Value 2"}}

function spawnInfernus(pPlayer)
	local playerType = getElementType(pPlayer) == "player" -- check if it's player

	if playerType then -- if so
		local dataPack = false -- store it for later reuse
		local dataName = false -- store it for later reuse
		local dataValue = false -- store it for later reuse
		local playerX, playerY, playerZ = getElementPosition(pPlayer) -- get player position
		local infernusElement = createVehicle(411, playerX + 5, playerY, playerZ) -- create vehicle

		for dataID = 1, #dataTable do -- loop through data table
			dataPack = dataTable[dataID] -- get data at certain index
			dataName = dataPack[1] -- get data name
			dataValue = dataPack[2] -- get data value

			setCustomData(infernusElement, dataName, dataValue, "synced", false, pPlayer, "spawn_infernus", "queue_spawn_infernus", -1)
			-- set data for vehicle, with specified name and value, with type "synced", receivers false, pPlayer as syncer, "spawn_infernus" as event name and queue "queue_spawn_infernus" with timeout -1 (batch)
		end

		forceBatchDataSync("queue_spawn_infernus", "synced") -- force "queue_spawn_infernus" to sync from "synced" type
	end
end
addCommandHandler("spawninfernus", spawnInfernus)


	Second way is using buffer, the difference between previous technique is that instead awaiting synchronization we create a timer which collects pack of data with given delay. Using it also results in data reduction, because calls are reduced. You can apply it to data which is being changed by multiple players, or in different scenario where you'd want to collect various data and sync them in same queue, i'll also include handy code by @IIYAMA which would help you adjust your delay. 
	 
 

local sendingDelay = 100 -- ms
local fps = 60

local timeSlice = 1000/fps
local dataReduction = sendingDelay/timeSlice

print("~"..(dataReduction - 1).." x times LESS per "..sendingDelay.." ms.")


	An simple buffer example: 
	 
 

function bufferExample(pPlayer)
	local playerType = getElementType(pPlayer) == "player" -- check if it's player

	if playerType then -- if so
		local bufferChanges = getCustomData(pPlayer, "Buffer changes", "private", pPlayer) or 0 -- get changes for this data

		setCustomData(pPlayer, "Buffer changes", bufferChanges + 1, "private", pPlayer, pPlayer, "buffer_change", "queue_buffer_change", 3000)

		bufferChanges = getCustomData(pPlayer, "Buffer changes", "private", pPlayer) -- get once again changes for this data

		outputChatBox("Data has changed for player: "..getPlayerName(pPlayer).." -&gt; Buffer changes: "..bufferChanges)
	end
end
addCommandHandler("buffertest", bufferExample)


	



	Data handlers - awesome addition
 


	Meet data handlers, equivalent of onClientElementDataChange, those are your own custom functions which could be attached to certain element, data type, key, and event. 
	Once the function is triggered, it provides set of useful parameters which could be used inside function scope, this is another feature which makes this data system powerful. 
	For examples, we'll refer to previously set data with batch and buffer. 
	 
 

function onClientInternusDataChange(pElement, pKey, pType, pOldValue, pNewValue, pEvent, pSyncer)
	if pSyncer == localPlayer then
		print("I am syncer of this data! At event: "..tostring(pEvent))
	end

	print("Key: "..pKey.." ("..pType..") has changed: "..tostring(pOldValue).." -&gt; "..tostring(pNewValue))
end
addDataHandler("vehicle", {}, {}, onClientInternusDataChange, "spawn_infernus") -- requirements to trigger function: element needs to be vehicle, any data type and key name can trigger this, event needs to be equal to "spawn_infernus"

--[[
/***************************************************

***************************************************\
]]

function onClientBufferChange(pElement, pKey, pType, pOldValue, pNewValue, pEvent, pSyncer)
	if pSyncer == localPlayer then
		print("I am syncer of this data! At event: "..tostring(pEvent))
	end

	print("Key: "..pKey.." ("..pType..") has changed: "..tostring(pOldValue).." -&gt; "..tostring(pNewValue))
end
addDataHandler("player", "private", "Buffer changes", onClientBufferChange, "buffer_change") -- requirements to trigger function: element needs to be player, data type == "private" and key name == "Buffer changes" can trigger this, event needs to be equal to "buffer_change"


	



	How to use it?
 


	Download latest version, and add it directly to your gamemode, to use functions directly or leave it as a separate resource to use functions with exports. First option gives best performance, and allows you to use data handlers. Make sure that player parent isn't changed, in order for server-side to work correctly.

		ED: 31 ms &lt; CD: 17 ms
	 

	
		Get local data by key:
	 

	
		ED: 19 ms &lt; CD: 9 ms
	 

	
		Get all local data:
	 

	
		ED: n/a &lt; CD: 10 ms

			Hi there.
 


	Oh, what is that? The holidays are here again? Yep, it looks like they are, so that means the usual stuff. We are going to give you guys &amp; gals a heads up on what has been happening in MTA's world this whole year. And if you are one of those well informed types who does not need a recap, you still might want to give this post a read, as there will be more than that later on!
 


	 
 


	 2016 in Recap
 


		Near the end of January, we released a bugfix release for MTA:SA 1.5.x - Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.2. Among a few other things, that version had and improved the server app compatibility for Linux server hosters and fixed some desync issues.
	
	
		
			In July, we started offering a new way of promotion for server owners who wanted to gain more players quickly. Namely, one of the top positions in the ingame server browser for a week in an exchange for a small fee. We felt it was a good way to not only ensure that our Project's financial needs are balanced, but also to allow some smaller but ambitious servers to try and get the player base they were always seeking for.
		 
	
	
		
			In August and September, we made significant changes to our forums, including a switch to a new forum software. There were a bunch of issues found afterwards (such as keeping the users login states), but we managed to fix most of them.
		 
	
	
		
			Following that, we were featured in an article on the Rock Paper Shotgun, which was pondering the popularity of multiplayer mods for GTASA, even long after its original release. You can find the full article on the RPS website.
		 
	
	
		
			And finally, on 20th of October, Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas 1.5.3 was released. This was a large release that could as well have been labelled as a next major release, but was not as it was still compatible with the 1.5 series.

	Yes, to our surprise, there was a new concurrent unique player count record set literally on the day we were gathering these stats for you.
 


	 
 


				MTA:SA Version or series
			
			
				Percentage of players using that version or series as of 23rd of December, 2016
			
		
				1.5.3

				0.28%
			
		
				1.0.x + 1.1.x + 1.2.x
			
			
				0.07%
			
		
	It looks like more people decided to use newer versions of the mod than the last year.
 


	 
 


	***
 


	As for the future, we have been working on the next release, which will contain mostly bugfixes and compatibility tweaks. However, we did some work on new features as well, such as Custom Train Tracks, which we hope to be finished soon.
 


	We also want to look into improving streaming, raising the limits and making it possible to add new IDs for things, but this will be tricky. Nonetheless, it would be great to see those features working in MTA:SA one day as, for example, they would allow server owners to use bigger and better custom maps with new vehicles working correctly for all players.
 


	 
	That's it for now. 
	Happy Holidays and Best Wishes for 2017 from the MTA Team!

			addEventHandler + group elements
		 

		
			I noticed that some people like to add 10000000000000000 addEventHandlers for each element, while you probably only need 1 addEventHandler.
		 

		
			
				 
			 
		

		
			

		
			 
		 

		
			Using ONE addEventHandler on a group of elements?
		 

		
			Answer:
		 

		
local group = createElement("groupMyCutePeds") -- Create a custom element and save it in to the variable &lt;group&gt;.



-- Create 3 peds.
local ped1 = createPed(120, 5540.6654, 1020.55122, 1240.545)
local ped2 = createPed(120, 5541.6654, 1021.55122, 1240.545)
local ped3 = createPed(120, 5542.6654, 1022.55122, 1240.545)


-- Set the parent of the 3 peds.
setElementParent(ped1, group)
setElementParent(ped2, group)
setElementParent(ped3, group)



-- Add an addEventHandler and use the &lt;group&gt; as &lt;attachedTo&gt; element.
addEventHandler("onPedWasted", group, -- "onPedWasted" = serverside. "onClientPedWasted" = clientside.
function ()
	outputChatBox("One of my cute peds just died. ;'( No exceptions!")
end)

		
			Code is untested, but the method is tested. 
			 
		 

		
			 
		 

		
			
				 
			 
		

		
			

		
			Syntax for functions in example
		 

		
			createElement syntax
		 

		
element createElement ( string elementType, [ string elementID = nil ] )

		
			 
		 

		
			setElementParent syntax
		 

		
bool setElementParent ( element theElement, element parent )  

		
			 
		 

		
			addEventHandler syntax
		 

		
bool addEventHandler ( string eventName, element attachedTo, function handlerFunction, [ bool getPropagated = true, string priority = "normal" ] )

		
			DO NOT disable getPropagated
		 

		
			
				getPropagated: A boolean representing whether the handler will be triggered if the event was propagated down or up the element tree (starting from the source), and not triggered directly on attachedTo (that is, handlers attached with this argument set to false will only be triggered if source == this).
			 
		

		
			If you disable this, children of the &lt;group&gt; element are not included.
		 

		
			 
		 

		
			 
		

		
			

		
			 
		 

		
			Make use of the element tree
		 

		
			
				 

			
				 
			 

			
				Element tree
			 

			
				 
			 

			
				For applying addEventHandlers to elements created by the resource:
			 

			
				Use: resourceRoot / getResourceRootElement
			 

			
				 
			 

			
				For applying addEventHandlers to elements created by scripts of the resource:
			 

			
				Use: getResourceDynamicElementRoot
			 

			
				 
			 

			
				For applying addEventHandlers to elements created by maps of the resource:
			 

			
				Use: getResourceMapRootElement
			 
		

		
			 
		 
		 

		
			
				 
			 
		

		
			

		
			 
		 

		
			I hope your code will be without... 
		 

		
print(10^10^10^10) -- Print here: https://www.lua.org/cgi-bin/demo

		
			...addEventHandlers in the future.

			Hello,
 


	We, the eXo-Reallife team, would like to release a module that is also used on our server. 
	It is a pathfinding module developed by Jusonex and StiviK. 
	The module uses the A * algorithm. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) 
	We use this for our GPS:
 


	 


	 Why did we develop a module for this and did not simply write a script? 
	This has a very simple reason. The module calculates the routes in your own threads, which has the advantage that it is much faster than a script, and secondly, you can calculate how much routes as you want side by side. This will not cause any lags etc.!
 


	What are the features of the module?
 


		The module can load several graphs / nodes side by side
	
	
		The module calculates the routes in its own threads
	
	
		Very useful API functions (such as findNodeAt or getNodeNeighbors)
	

	What are the main features? int loadPathGraph (String pathToGraphFile) 
	This function loads the graph from the given file and returns a GraphId which you need for all other functions. If something does not work, false is returned.  bool findShortestPathBetween (int graphId, float startX, float startY, float startZ, float endX, float endY, float endZ, function callback) 
	This function finds the shortest route between the points. (Unfortunately, no vectors can be handed over!) 
	The callback function is called when the calculation is finished. As an argument, either a table is returned that contains all nodes, or false if no route is found.  bool unloadPathGraph (int graphId) 
	You can use this function if you no longer need and want to unload the graph, it returns true if everything is fine, false if an error has occurred.
 


	You will find all the other functions that are included in our documentation.  Why is the eXo team releasing all this? 
	Well, that has the simple reason, we want to share our work with others and not just keep it for us! We hope we can enrich you with it and vlt. Even help!
 


	Where can I download the module? 
	The whole module is open-source and can be viewed in our GitHub organization. 
	It's released under the MIT License.
 


	GitHub organization: https://github.com/eXo-MTA 
	Repository: https://github.com/eXo-MTA/ml_pathfind 
	Download the module (Windows / Linux): https://github.com/eXo-MTA/ml_pathfind/releases 
	Nodes of all roads in SA: https://github.com/eXo-MTA/ml_pathfind/blob/master/test/sa_nodes.json
 


	If you find any mistakes or suggestions, you can simply create a new issue and we will look into it.
 


	So now that's it, have fun with the module!
 


	- StiviK and the eXo-Reallife team

			Today i proudly present to you: OSWS (OpenSourceWaterShader) for MTA: San Andreas!
 


	What is this? 
	 
	This resource is a project that i started long ago in order to finally (!) get a decent water shader working for MTA that benefits everybody. The main goal is to get an amazing shader where everyone should contribute to make it the very best looking water that we can get for this game engine. The code is pretty well optimized and the performance should be good for everyone, but a shader model 3.0 graphics card is REQUIRED for this resource! 
	The effect is applied to the water texture itself. It is NOT a post-processing water shader. This means that we do not have to deal with any issues that come with post-processing, for example smoke and any other effect that is rendering behind the drawn water. The downside of this method is the fact that we can not (as far as i know) add refraction to the stuff that is below the water surface. But maybe some genius knows a way to make it happen, or fix the rendering issues of post-processed water. Stuff like that is the main reason why i decided to make this resource a community project, improvements for everyone!

	Lua



	This part of the tutorial discusses Lua itself. No MTA-specific concepts will be discussed here.
 


	Scripts



	The Lua scripting language is a language which is interpreted by a "Lua interpreter". MTA:SA's resources use such an interpreter to run Lua code. For the beginning of this tutorial you can use the online Lua interpreter available on https://www.Lua.org/demo.html. Any code in the Lua part of the tutorial can be run on this website.
 


	Lua is written in "plain text". This means it exists of regular characters like any other text you are writing. To edit Lua files you will require a text editor. You could use Notepad, but there are many far better alternatives. My personal favourite is Visual Studio Code, but there are many other good options, to name a few: Atom, sublime text, notepad++ 
	Lua files are usually saved with the .Lua file extension
 


	Variables



	The first concept we're going to discuss is variables. Variables allow you to store a value in your code. 
	For example:
 


	
x = 10

print(x)



	print(x) will output the value of the x variable. We will get into what exactly print is later in the tutorial.
 


	Variables can have any name you want, as long as you follow some specific rules.
 


	
		variable names must start with a letter (lower or upper case), or an underscore (_)
	
	
		variable names may contain letters (lower and upper case), numbers and underscores.
	



	
x = 10
y = 20
z = 30

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)



	The convention in Lua is to name your variables in "camelCase". This means if a variable exists of multiple words you start every word with a capital letter, except for the first one.
 


	
camelCaseVariable = 5



	Data types



	So far we've seen variables used to store numeric values, but there are many different types of data Lua can handle. These are:
 


	
		number 
		Any numeric value
	
	
		string 
		A piece of text, a string is surrounded by " or '. For example "Hello world" or 'Hello world'
	
	
		boolean 
		A boolean is a data type that has only 2 options, true and false.
	
	
		nil 
		nil is a value indicating nothing. It's the absence of a value. (Not the be confused with 0)
	
	
		table 
		Tables will be discussed later in the tutorial
	
	
		userdata 
		Userdata will be discussed later in the tutorial
	
	
		function 
		Functions will be discussed later in the tutorial
	
	
		thread 
		Threads are out of scope for this tutorial and won't be discussed
	



	So we can use these different data types, and store them in variables:
 


	
numberVariable = 10
stringVariable = "Hello world"
booleanVariable = true
nilVariable = nil



	Operators



	Operators are symbols in Lua which can be used to do "things" with variables. Here's a list of operators and an example for each:
 


	+ operator



	Adds two values together
 


	
x = 10 + 10
print(x)

y = 20
print(y)

z = x + y
print(z)



	- operator



	Subtracts a value from another value
 


	
x = 10 - 10
print(x)



	* operator



	Multiplies two values
 


	
x = 10 * 10
print(x)



	/ operator



	Divides a value by another value
 


	
x = 10 / 10
print(x)



	% operator



	This is the "modulo" operator. This will divide a value by another, and return the leftover.
 


	
x = 10 % 4
print(x)



	The result of this is 2
 


	and operator



	The and operator will return true if both variables are "truthy". Otherwise it returns false 
	(A "truthy" value is anything except for false and nil)
 


	
x = true and false
print(x)

y = true and true
print(y)



	or operator



	The and operator will return true if one of the variables are "truthy". Otherwise it returns false
 


	
x = true or false
print(x)

y = false or false
print(y)



	== operator



	The == (equals) operator will return true if both of the variables are the same. Otherwise it returns false
 


	
x = "hey there" == "hello there"
print(x)

y = 150 == 150
print(y)



	~= operator



	The ~= (does not equal) operator will return true if both variables are not the same. Otherwise it returns false
 


	
x = "hey there" ~= "hello there"
print(x)

y = 150 ~= 150
print(y)



	&gt; operator



	The &gt; (greater than) operator will return true if the first value is greater than the second value. Otherwise it returns false
 


	
x = 10 &gt; 5
print(x)

y = 10 &gt; 15
print(y)

y = 10 &gt; 10
print(y)



	&gt;= operator



	The &gt;= (greater than or equals) operator will return true if the first value is greater than, or equal to, the second value. Otherwise it returns false
 


	
x = 10 &gt; 5
print(x)

y = 10 &gt; 15
print(y)

y = 10 &gt; 10
print(y)



	&lt; operator



	The &lt; (less than) operator will return true if the first value is less than the second value. Otherwise it returns false
 


	
x = 10 &lt; 5
print(x)

y = 10 &lt; 15
print(y)

y = 10 &lt; 10
print(y)



	&lt;= operator



	The &lt;= (less than or equals) operator will return true if the first value is less than, or equal to, the second value. Otherwise it returns false
 


	
x = 10 &lt; 5
print(x)

y = 10 &lt; 15
print(y)

y = 10 &lt; 10
print(y)



	.. operator



	The .. (string concatanation) operator allows you to add two strings together.
 


	
x = "Hello"
z = "World!"

combined = x .. " " .. z
print(combined)



	If statements



	An if statement allows your code to decide to do something, or not. Depending on a value. Often times if statements are used in combination with some of the above operators.
 


	An if statement is written as : if &lt;expression&gt; then &lt;code&gt; end
 


	
x = 10
if x &gt; 5 then
    print("X is higher than 5")
end



	Any code between then and end will only be executed when the expression is true. You might also have noticed that the code between the then and end is moved over a bit to the right. This is called "indentation". Whenever we open a new scope (scopes will be discussed later in the tutorial) we move our code to the right. This is usually done by either a tab or several spaces . Many code editors will convert a tab to spaces.
 


	Else



	Within an if statement, you can also add an else block. The code in such a block will be executed when the code in the if block is not executed.
 


	
x = 10
if x &gt; 5 then
    print("X is higher than 5")
else
    print("X is not higher than 5")
end



	Elseif



	If you want to do multiple if statements, you can use an elseif:
 


	
x = 15
if x &gt; 10 then
    print("X is higher than 10")
end
if x &gt; 5 then
    print("X is higher than 5")
end



	
x = 15
if x &gt; 10 then
    print("X is higher than 10")
elseif x &gt; 5 then
    print("X is higher than 5")
end



	The difference between the first example and the second is that if x is higher than 10 in the first example both lines "X is higher than 10" and "X is higher than 5" will be output. Whilst in the second example only "X is higher than 10" will be output.
 


	And if statement must always start with an if, can contain multiple elseifs, and may only have one else.
 


	
name = "NanoBob"
if name == "NanoBob" then
    print("Hello world!")
elseif name == "Brophy" then
    print("Black 123")
elseif name == "Tombaa" then
    print("Stupid")
else
    print("I have no idea")
end



	Functions



	Functions allow you to write less code, by reusing pieces of code.
 


	The syntax to create a function is function &lt;name&gt;(&lt;parameters&gt;) &lt;code&gt; end
 


	
function foo()
    print("Hello world #1")
    print("Hello world #2")
end



	In order to execute code in the function, you "call" the function. You do this by writing the function name followed by ().
 


	
function foo()
    print("Hello world #1")
    print("Hello world #2")
end

foo()
foo()
foo()



	Functions also allow you to send a variable to the function, for it to do something with. This is what's called a function parameter. Function parameters are defined in the brackets () after the function name.
 


	
function foo(x)
    print(x)
end

foo(10)
foo("50")



	You may notice that this looks a lot like the print() we have been using. This is because print is a built-in Lua function.
 


	Return values



	A function not only can execute code, it can also give something back to where it was called. This is called a return value. In order to return something from a function you use the return keyword.
 


	
function foo()
    return 10
end

x = foo()
print(x)

print(foo())



	Just like in an if statement, all code within a function is indented.
 


	Now let's combine everything we have learnt so far:
 


	
function foo(x)
    if x &gt; 10 then
        return "X is higher than 10"
    elseif x &gt; 5 then
        return "X is higher than 5"
    else
        return "X is not higher than 5"
    end
end

y = foo(15)
print(y)

print(foo(10))
print(foo(0))



	Scopes &amp; locals



	We quickly encountered scopes before, and said we indent our code whenever we enter a new scope. But scopes allow you to do more than that. Most importantly, "local" variables.
 


	A local variable is only available in the scope it was defined in (or scopes that were created from within that scope)
 


	You can create a new scope using a do block (functions and if statements also have their own scope).
 


	
do
    local x = 5
    print(x)
end
print(x)



	
do 
    local x = 5
    do 
        local y = 10
        print(x)
        print(y)
    end
    print(y)
end



	For loops



	(For) loops are ways in scripting / programming to have code executed multiple times, without having to write the same thing multiple times. 
	An example of such a loop:
 


	
for i = 1, 10 do
    print(i)
end



	The first part : i = 1, 10 defines a variable called i. Which start at 1. This will be incremented by 1, until it reaches 10. The code within the loop then can use this variable.
 


	You can also increment with a different number than 1 (including negative numbers) using this construct.
 


	
for i = 20, 0, -2 do
    print(i)
end



	This code sample will start with i at 20, and keep adding -2 (thus subtracting 2), until it reaches 0
 


	Tables



	Tables are a datatype in Lua which allows for lists of things. 
	Here's an example:
 


	
x = {
    [1] = 100,
    [2] = 200,
    [3] = 300
}

print(x[1])
print(x[2])
print(x[3])



	Tables consist of key/value pairs. In the example above the key 1, has the value 100, 2 has the value 200, and 3 has the value 300. 
	You can get the value in a table, by putting the key in between square brackets []. Like in print(x[1]).
 


	
x = {
    100,
    200,
    300
}

print(x[1])
print(x[2])
print(x[3])



	You can choose to not include the keys in a table. Doing so will automatically add numbers as keys, starting at 1. So the above example would be the exact same as the first example.
 


	Table keys and values can be of any data type, including other tables. This allows you to create (very) complex table structures.
 


	
t = {
    [1] = {
        100,
        200,
        300
    },
    ["x"] = 100,
    [true] = "something"
}
print(t["x"])
print(t[true])

print(t[1][1])
print(t[1][2])
print(t[1][3])



	When using a string as the key in a table, you can leave out the square brackets and the quotes. This goes for both when defining the table, and for indexing it (getting a value from it). For example
 


	
t = {
    x = 100,
    y = 200,
    z = 300
}

print(t.x)
print(t.y)
print(t.z)



	A table's values can be modified / set after creating the table as well.
 


	
t = {}

t[1] = 10
t[2] = 20
t[3] = 30

t["x"] = "banana"
t[true] = false
t.x = "banana"



	When using tables you will often want to add something to the "end" of a table. This is most common when you are using tables with numeric keys. 
	In order to do this you can use a # to get the amount of items currently in the table.
 


	
t = {
    10,
    20,
    30
}

t[#t + 1] = 40



	This will store the value 40 on the key 4 , because #t is 3.
 


	Iterators (pairs/ipairs)



	Iterators are a mechanism that allow you to make a loop, which goes over a set of values. Writing your own iterators won't be discussed in this tutorial. But there are two functions which are often used to create an iterator to iterate over a table. These are pairs and ipairs.
 


	
t = {
    10, 20, 30, 40, 50
}

for key, value in ipairs(t) do
    print(key, value)
end



	The difference between pairs and ipairs is the order in which the key/value pairs are iterated over, and which of the key/value pairs are iterated over. 
	Where ipairs will always use numeric keys, starting at 1, and going up by 1 every time, until there is no entry in the table. This also means it won't iterate over anything key that is not numeric.
 


	
t = {
    ["x"] = 5,
    [1] = 10,
    [2] = 20,
    [3] = 30,
    [5] = 50,
}

for key, value in ipairs(t) do
    print(key, value)
end



	A pairs loop will iterate over any value in a table, but the order is not guaranteed. Meaning that between different runs of the script the order could be different.
 


	
t = {
    ["x"] = 5,
    [1] = 10,
    [2] = 20,
    [3] = 30,
    [5] = 50,
}

for key, value in pairs(t) do
    print(key, value)
end



	Callbacks



	Callbacks are when you pass a function as an argument to another function. To have the function you passed be called later on. This is used often within MTA.
 


	An example of a Lua function which uses a callback is table.sort. table.sort will sort a tables values, by default these values are sorted numerically. But you can use a callback to change this behaviour.
 


	
values = {
    5, 4, 3, 6, 8, 1, 2, 9, 7
}

function sortFunction(a, b)
    return b &gt; a
end

function reverseSortFunction(a, b)
    return a &gt; b
end

table.sort(values, sortFunction)
print("Sorted: ")
for _, v in ipairs(values) do
    print(v)
end


table.sort(values, reverseSortFunction)
print("\nReverse sorted: ")
for _, v in ipairs(values) do
    print(v)
end



	In the first call to table.sort (table.sort(values, sortFunction)) you can see the sortFunction function is passed as second argument to the function. Note that we don't write sortFunction() here (notice the brackets difference) because that would call the sortFunction function, and pass its return value to table.sort.
 


	table.sort will then call this function when it compares two different values, this function should return true or false depending on whether its second argument (b in this case) is larger than it's first argument (a), in the context of sorting.
 


	Anonymous functions



	It is also possible to use an "anonymous function" when passing a callback to a function.
 


	
values = {
    5, 4, 3, 6, 8, 1, 2, 9, 7
}

table.sort(values, function(a, b)
    return b &gt; a
end)

print("Sorted: ")
for _, v in ipairs(values) do
    print(v)
end


table.sort(values, function(a, b)
    return a &gt; b
end)

print("\nReverse sorted: ")
for _, v in ipairs(values) do
    print(v)
end



	MTA



	This part of the tutorial discusses MTA specific constructs. Code in this part of the tutorial won't run in the online Lua interpreter. You will need to set up a (local) server for this.
 


	Server &amp; Resources



	By default when installing MTA:SA a server is installed as well. This server is located in the "server" directory of your MTA directory. This is usually at C:\Program Files (x86)\MTA San Andreas 1.5\server. This directory contains an MTA server.exe file, running this file will start a server.
 


	Scripts on a server are grouped by resources, a single resource can consist of multiple script files and other assets such as images, sounds, fonts, mods and more.
 


	Resources are placed in your mods\deathmatch\resources folder in your server folder. A resource is always in its own directory. A resource must always have a single meta.xml file. This file tells the server (among others) what script files to load. A typical meta.xml file looks like this:
 


	
&lt;meta&gt;
    &lt;script src="vehicleSystem.Lua" type="server"/&gt;
    &lt;script src="vehicleMods.Lua" type="client"/&gt;
&lt;/meta&gt;



	You will need an entry for every .Lua file you want to have executed on the server.
 


	You can start a resource by typing start &lt;resource name&gt; in the server console (the window that opened when you started MTA Server.exe). The resource name is the name of the directory your meta.xml is in. (This may not have spaces). 
	Starting a resource will start running the Lua scripts, if you've changed your scripts you will need to restart the resource for the changes to take effect. (restart &lt;resource name&gt;).
 


	Server vs client



	Lua code can be executed in one of two places. The server, or the client. 
	Server sided scripts are executed on the actual machine that is running the MTA server.exe process. 
	Client sided scripts are executed on the computer of every player that connects to your server.
 


	Server sided and client sided scripts have a distinct difference in responsibility and possibility. Some functions for example are only available on the client, whilst others are available only on the server (and many on both).
 


	Note: Some of these functions which are available both server sided and client sided are different on server and client
 


	MTA functions &amp; wiki



	In plain Lua there's not much you can do to affect a game engine like MTA:SA. This is why MTA:SA offers a (large) list of functions available for you to use in your scripts which interact with the actual GTA world. 
	You can find a list of all of these, what they do and how to use them on the MTA wiki.
 


	
		Server sided functions
	
	
		Client sided functions
	
	
		shared functions
	



	An example of such a function is createObject(). This function will create a physical object in the game. The wiki page contains information on how to use it (what arguments it expects, and in what order). And often shows an example of how to use it.
 


	
createObject(1337, 0, 0, 3)



	Elements (userdata)



	At the start of this tutorial we quickly mentioned userdata data types. These are data types configurable by the implementation of Lua. In this case, MTA. 
	MTA uses userdata to represent "elements". Many things in MTA are elements, like objects, markers, peds, players, user interfaces, vehicles, etc. 
	On the MTA wiki you will notice many functions either return elements, or require an element as arguments. 
	A list of different types of elements can be found on the MTA wiki.
 


	Elements also have a hierarchical structure to them. Elements can have a "parent", and multiple "children". This will result in a tree of elements, the element at the top of this tree (and thus the grandparent of all elements) is called the root element.
 


	Command handlers



	Often times in MTA you want certain things to happen when a player enters a command. This is done using command handlers, command handlers use a callback, which we previously discussed. 
	The wiki contains a page for the addCommandHandler() function. For this example we will be using the server side version.
 


	
function handler(player, command, argument)
    outputChatBox("You entered " .. command)
    if argument ~= nil then
        outputChatBox("You used the argument " .. argument, player)
    end
end

addCommandHandler("banana", handler)



	This example also uses the outputChatBox() function, this will output a piece of text to the chat.(in this case, only for the player who executed the command)
 


	The callback function passed to addCommandHandler will be called every time a player uses the /banana command ingame.
 


	Event handlers



	Besides having your script do things when a user executes a command you likely want the game to respond to many different types of things that happen in the game. Like players taking damage, coming close to something, etc. 
	These things are called events. Whenever an event is triggered you can run a piece of Lua code. You do this using event handlers. Event handlers are created using the addEventHandler().
 


	The first argument to the addEventHandler() function is the string name of the event. These can be found on the MTA wiki as well.
 


	
		Server sided events
	
	
		Client sided events
	



	An event is always triggered for a specific element, for example "onPlayerWasted" is triggered on the player that was wasted (killed). 
	You can attach an event handler to a single element to only have your callback function be called when the event is triggered on that specific element. But you could also use the root element here and your function will be called for every element the event is triggered on.
 


	
function handlePlayerDeath()
    outputChatBox("You died!!", source)
end
addEventHandler("onPlayerWasted", getRootElement(), handlePlayerDeath)



	The getRootElement() function used in this example returns the root element discussed earlier. 
	You can also see source is used in this code snippet, we'll talk about that some more in the next section.
 


	predefined globals



	MTA has some predifined global variables for you to use in your script. 
	A list of them can be found on the wiki.
 


	Here's a couple notable ones and what they're used for
 


	
		root The root element, same as the return value of getRootElement())
	
	
		source 
		The element an event handler was called on. An event's wiki page always describes what the event source will be for the event.
	
	
		localPlayer The player element for the player whose client the script is running on. (Thus only available client sided)
	
	
		client Will be discussed in the next section
	



	server &lt;-&gt; client communication



	As stated earlier in this tutorial scripts can run either on the server, or one of the connected clients. However often times you would want to trigger something on the server from a client, or the other way around.
 


	An example of this would be when the user clicks the login button on a GUI (Graphical user interface) the server should try to log that person in, and send him back whether or not this was successful.
 


	This can be done using events. MTA allows you to create and trigger your own events, and these events can be triggered from server to client (and the other way around). You can do this using the addEvent() function. 
	Once an event has been added (and marked as remotely triggerable by passing true as second argument to addEvent()) you can call it from server/client. You do this using [triggerClientEvent()]https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/TriggerClientEvent() and triggerServerEvent() respectively.
 


	Server sided:
 


	
function handlePlayerLogin(username, password)
    outputChatBox("You tried to log in with the username " .. username, client)
end
addEvent("LuaTutorial.Login", true)
addEventHandler("LuaTutorial.Login", root, handlePlayerLogin)



	Client sided:
 


	
function pretendLogin()
    triggerServerEvent("LuaTutorial.Login", localPlayer, "username", "password")
end

pretendLogin()



	This example will trigger the "LuaTutorial.Login" event from the client sided script. And passes the "username" and "password" arguments to the event. 
	The server then handles this event in the handlePlayerLogin() function, which in our case just outputs something to the chatbox.
 


	In this example you can see the previously mentioned client global variable. 
	This variable is set to the player element corresponding to the client the event was triggered from. (And is thus only usable when used in an event handler which has been triggered from a client).
 


	Now what?



	With this information you should be able to start scripting, and making things in MTA! If you didn't understand it all in one go, or you have any more questions there is no shame in that! 
	You can find myself and many others willing to help you with your scripting questions in the #scripting channel on the MTA discord. 
	Another good source for programming / scripting related questions is stack overflow.

			Hi there!
 


	Our next release is nearly done. However, to ensure that it meets our high quality standards, we would like to ask you guys to thoroughly test it before we release it.
 


	This release brings an important change to our release distribution system. Starting today, there will be two builds available for you to download:
 


		normal build - only works on Windows 7 and above
	
	
		legacy build - only works on Windows XP and Windows Vista
	

	A normal build is basically what we offered with our previous releases, with an exception that it now requires Windows 7 or above to run.
 


	The new thing is an legacy build, which only works on Windows XP and Windows Vista. This build uses the last CEF components version that works on XP/Vista, which is now outdated and insecure. To ensure that we will not leave some of our players in the dark, while keeping the rest of them secure, we decided to split the release into two builds. One which uses older CEF components and works on XP/Vista (legacy  build), and the other one which has up-to-date CEF but only works on Windows 7 and above (normal build).
 


	We have elaborated more on this in a separate post which you can find here.
 


	MTA:SA 1.5.3 has a lot of other smaller bug fixes, tweaks and new features included and is a result of another change to our build system, which simplified the development and building process to us. This has also allowed us to back-port many of the smaller changes originally planned for the 1.6 release to 1.5.3. These changes should be compatible with the 1.5 series, but they still need to be tested to ensure that this is indeed the case. 
	And this is where you guys come in.
 


	To help us testing the version, simply download the Release Candidate from links below, install it and play as you normally would. If you play on XP or Vista, download the legacy build, otherwise grab the normal one. This version is meant to be fully compatible with MTA:SA 1.5.2 or below, so just join your favourite server and give it a go. If you encounter a problem or spot a bug, you can report them to our bugtracker. Please use the search feature first to see if your problem was not already reported though... 
	Updated Windows/Linux server packages are also available, and similarly, they are also compatible with 1.5.2 clients, so please test whether your servers work fine on 1.5.3 too.
 


	 
 


	Click here to download MTA:SA 1.5.3 RC Normal Build (for Windows 7 and above)
 


	Click here to download MTA:SA 1.5.3 RC Legacy Build (Windows XP and Vista only)
 


	 MTA:SA 1.5.3 RC Linux Server download page
 


	 
 


	You can find the current list of changes for this version here. A summary of changes and credits list will be provided with the final release announcement post.
 


	 
 


	Thank you for helping us make MTA great again awesome.

			Slipe is an open source framework that enables anyone to write scripts for MTA:San Andreas in C# instead of Lua, wrapping all MTA elements and classes and including some .NET Core namespaces. It is based on CSharp.Lua by Yang Huan.
 


	Slipe features:
 


	
		Runs on Windows and Linux
	
	
		Built in continuous deployment support with (GitHub) webhooks
	
	
		Object oriented wrappers for all MTA elements
	
	
		Async/await for MTA functions that use callbacks
	
	
		C# style Http requests, sockets and XML methods.
	
	
		Use Visual Studio and its Intellisense
	
	
		Type safety
	



	You can find more information about the project on https://prod.mta-slipe.com.
 


	
		Our Discord
	
	
		Our Github
	



	The project is still in Alpha, and since it is open source anyone is welcome to contribute

	This board is for global MTA bans only ("You have been banned by MTA"). 
	It's not to be used for when you get banned from a server. In the case of server bans, please contact the admin of that server or use their website/forums to appeal if they have one.
 


	 
 


	If you want to appeal a global ban, then please create a new topic HERE (click) that includes atleast your MTA serial.
 


	How to find your serial: launch MTA, press the F8 key and write ``serial`` into it. Now, select your serial and copy it using CTRL + C, then paste it into your appeal topic.
 


	 
 


	If you received a global ban, you can appeal it under certain circumstances.
 


	Examples: 
	- The ban is permanent, or has a pretty long duration (a month or more). 
	* If a ban is permanent, no duration (ban time left) is shown in the ban message.
 


	- The ban is custom. This is the case when your ban message shows a reason that is not "TRAINER" or "DLL INJECTOR". 
	* This can happen when you got banned as a result of illegal conduct on MTA. 
	* The possibility to appeal bans mostly exists for these situations, where your appeal will prompt us to review if you can be unbanned, based on the offense and its severity.
 


	If you post an appeal and your ban doesn't fall under the above circumstances, then it may be removed rather than being answerred (although we more often do our best to make people understand the specific reason of their ban). This is because of the sheer volume of appeals for automated bans (for  trying to run old, detected cheats or 1-hour bans for DLL injectors) would otherwise be insane. If it's a short-duration ban, then please just wait for the ban to expire.
 


	Important: if you re-post a ban appeal (or post after having already been told the outcome) because you don't agree with our decision which is final, or evade forum bans in order to keep posting appeals, they won't even be read - and will be instantly deleted upon getting noticed. Any account that posts appeals fitting this profile, risks getting banned.. so sending your friends to do it for you is also a bad idea. We don't like persistent people and will do all it takes to stop them and their spam.
 


	 
 


	Explanation of the most common ban types and categories of bans they cover:
 


	"TRAINER" - Bans related to cheating: 
	- If the ban is temporary (a few hours to a couple of days), then you attempted to run a detected cheat or used it while it was still working.  
	* In the case of high-impact cheats, the ban duration can be a couple of weeks to a month. The same goes for paid (or subscription-based) cheats. 
	* It is also possible that MTA AC's heuristics flagged you for custom cheating, such as amateuristic attempts to modify memory or use your own little cheat. This can sometimes also result in a temporary ban.
 


	In such cases as the latter.. if you don't understand why or how MTA AC was able to detect you immediately, we advise you to read this topic (including its spoiler) and lay off of repeating this activity in the future. Both because you'll unlikely win from the AC, and because punishments will become gradually worse (kick &gt; tempban &gt; longer tempban &gt; permaban, but totally case by case, depending on the severity of your activities)
 


	- If the ban is permanent (note: with the type "TRAINER"), or for more than 2 months, then there can be several possibilities: 
	* We know that you're a cheat developer, and we took efforts to remove you from our platform in order to stop you from messing with MTA and its anti-cheat. 
	In this case, you have played your entitlements and we can deny your appeal on our discretion. However, we are always willing to give your case a fresh look. 
	If you think that you've learned from your mistakes, and are willing to use our Bug Bounty program in the future instead, you may be given another chance. So you're always welcome to appeal your ban.
 


	* You used a particularly serious (intrusive) cheat, one that we would call 'serious hackage', for example one that allowed you to ruin the game for everyone on a server or set out to harm a server or its integrity. 
	This also goes for attacks aimed at a server or its playerbase that were packaged as executable code that you loaded &amp; used in a cheat-like fashion.
 


	"REASON" - Custom bans that give a hint of the reason in your ban message. 
	If you engage in illegal activities, we consider it our duty to keep the rest of MTA safe from people such as yourself. Under no circumstance will we allow MTA to be used as a platform for illegal or malicious actions.
 


	Besides that, although this policy covers most situations and possible ban reasons, MTA staff can use their discretion to ban for any reason that can reasonably be considered as illegal, harmful, or damaging to MTA as a platform or its users. You will most definately be able to figure why you got banned from the ban reason text, and if you don't, you can always make an appeal to get further explanation.
 


	Also please note, if you post a ban appeal topic (for a ban about illegal conduct), you automatically agree that said topic, its content and any later posts in it won't ever be removed from the MTA forums. Reason being that while the ban was to protect MTA and its users/server owners from illegal conduct (malicious people such as yourself), if you later return to MTA others can be informed about you and your past to be prepared against falling victim to illegal conduct themselves. It helps for case-building (future offenses or moderators in need of referencing). We also reserve the right to add in (at most) MTA serial(s) to appeal topics.
 


	Common examples: 
	* "DDOS" 
	If you carry out DDoS/network attacks against MTA servers or other players, then you do not belong on MTA, and we will ban you to protect others on MTA against you and put consequences to it. 
	Therefore, when we receive a substantiated report about you, we may decide to ban you if there's overwhelming evidence, or ban you indefinitely for our investigation to proceed (read below for details).
 


	* "RAT"
 


	If you (try to) infect the PC of MTA players with viruses or (remote control) trojan, which are called RATs. The most common way is for someone to share infected file (links) in a server's chat, or directly to a person that you have a relation to because of MTA. We ban those that engage in illegal activities like this as well, because MTA will not be a platform for such acts; if someone deliberately tries to inflict harm or digital safety risks to another player, we believe that person doesn't belong on MTA.
 


	 
	* "EMAIL: ADDRESS"
 


	e.g "EMAIL: <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4f0c0c18777f770f08020e0603610c0002">[email&#160;protected]</a>" or "EMAIL: <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="bbf6f8faf08a8b8efbf4eeeff7f4f4f095f8f4f6">[email&#160;protected]</a>" 
	This ban message means you got banned to allow us to investigate something you were involved in.
 


	If you see this, then please send a message to the e-mail address that is mentioned, which belongs to the MTA staff member willing to investigate you. 
	It can be a result of a report against you (illegal activity, for example as described earlier) or (unknown/custom) cheats/hackage that you seem to have used and of which we want to learn more. 
	We may even desire to know more if MTA anti-cheat managed to block &amp; detect your attempts. For this reason, sometimes, temporary "TRAINER" bans may turn into this ban type or become extended/permanent. 
	Also, doing suspicious things while not getting banned (like only kicked by advanced AC heuristics) can have you confronted with such a ban when you launch MTA at a later point.
 


	If there's overwhelming evidence for what you're suspected of doing, you may aswell see a hint of the reason followed by the e-mail address.  
	Ex. "DDOS [EMAIL: ADDRESS]" 
	This means we're confident that you did it, but that we're still interested in talking to you anyways. It merely offers you a way out, perhaps to get unbanned (early) by cooperating with us, express regret, or share your side of the story. 
	At the same time, this type of ban message is also an encouragement to just accept your mistakes and move on, by understanding you did what the hint points to and that it got you caught. 
	Unlike the ban message saying "EMAIL: ADDRESS", the variation with "REASON [EMAIL: ADDRESS]" can aswell be temporary and be unbanned at a set date. So if you recognize and accept your mistake, just wait for it to expire.
 


	* "CHANGE" / "SERIAL CHANGE" 
	This ban message means that your serial (the one that got banned) isn't authentic: you (attempted to) change your MTA serial, and this got detected. 
	Using technical measures to try manipulate MTA into generating a new serial results in a ban on said serial if it appears to succeed. Because they get banned, it's not succesfull after all, because you now cannot use it. 
	If you return to using your original serial (undo the tampering that you tried getting it changed with), in most cases you will be able to play again.  
	If you cannot figure it out/are convinced that you didn't try to serial-change, then feel free to create a ban appeal topic and we'll check on your case.
 


	Note that persistent serial changing attempts/activities may result in you being punished, by having your main serial and all of your PC's banned, temporarily or permanently (on a case by case basis). These bans will usually show a reason similar to "MASS SERIAL CHANGING", "CONSTANT SERIAL CHANGING (ATTEMPTS)" and such. So just stop trying, it's better for yourself in the end.
 


	 
 


	* "BACKDOOR"
 


	This ban message means that you included a backdoor (or hidden commands with destructive or abusive functionality) in any script or gamemode that you (re)distributed, advertised or sold to any party. Investigation would result in a clear indication that you are in control of said backdoor.
 


	There are no excuses for the use of backdoors in MTA scripts. Justifications like "security" or "it's to protect from our gamemode being leaked" are invalid, because your actions in such a case would be an illegal action in itself (ex. using a command to set your own admin level would be considered hacking, using a command to shutdown/dump the server would be an hacking intrusion to the server infrastructure.. answerring immoral or bad acts with illegal acts isn't the right solution and will get you banned). Even though we now motivated this, we do realize that this excuse will be used to cover the intentions of 90% of the people who implant backdoors into their scripts and gamemodes, and still we do not believe this by default. But as you can see, such excuses would be invalid anyways.
 


	 
	* "[SERVICE] ABUSE" / ex. "FORUMS ABUSE" 
	In extreme cases of abuse on MTA services (such as forums, discord, community page), we may decide to global-ban you. 
	For example: 
	- if you're constantly evading bans on forums/discord, becoming a pest to our moderation team 
	- if you're uploading resources with backdoors/exploits (such as hidden commands or destructive functionality) to the community page 
	- if you're malicious towards the MTA infrastructure or intend to inflict MTA serious harm 
	- if you engage in unacceptable behavior towards MTA staff, such as blackmailing or threathening them or their surroundings, because they are doing their job
 


	Please always remember that MTA: San Andreas is made and ran by volunteers that devote their free time offering you a game to play on and have fun. 
	You're a guest, and not definately entitled to using our services; that's a favor. If you become very disruptive, causing us a lot of trouble, or soaking up moderation team resources to deal with the problems you cause us, 
	then don't be surprised if you're no longer welcome to play on the platform we offered you.
 


	*Note: the above text refers directly to the "SERVICE ABUSE" paragraph.
 


	 
 


	While the purpose of this topic is to explain why someone that wants to appeal may have been banned, it also contains our banning policy and a list of common bannable offenses. So as a side note, perhaps as a victim of something, if you want to report someone that has engaged in activity listed in here, then feel free to send a message to Dutchman101 and/or ccw (you could add both into the same conversation, but make sure to at least send it to Dutchman101 to ensure timely handling of your report).
 


	Note that for matters not related to illegal activity &amp; malicious acts but to cheating/working cheats, you should instead refer to the Bug Bounty topic and use its instructions on filing a report in the Private Bugs forum. We kindly request you to do this instead of sending a PM.

			Sphene is a SCM Interpreter in development for Multi Theft Auto. It is capable of running the mission scripts and parsing many other game files in order to recreate the storyline, minigames and anything else the default game has within Multi Theft Auto. We will then add Co-Op on top of it.
 


	In this video you are able to see Sphene run the N.O.E mission with only very minor bugs (such as the radar sound not always working). We did not specifically target this mission but the more we are able to implement all the game logic the more parts of the game become available. This is the first mission to be fully playable from start to end.

			For long time i considered to do something with physics in mta. For now doing even simplest things such falling box, tree on flat area looks cartoonish. In my history of i saw few attempts of doing simple physics, mostly it was in closed area without bigger interactions with poor performance due you just can't calculate collision in other way than processLineOfSight, isLineOfSightClear or read directly .col file as Tederis did.
 


	I started with something to render things, thats how FBX https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-blue/pull/1093 to bypass default rendering to handle future i'll introduce in future.
 


	That's how bullet physics project born, first idea how to use react physics, works simillar but is lighter and general smaller project but 0x416c69 suggested to use bullet. I'll use this topic also to prepare long list of features it contains for future copy paste to PR and wiki page
 


	 
 


	The main assumption is to allow for create multiple world with completly independed simulations, get and set detailed information about current step of simulation, fully control how everything is simulated, quality of collision tests, speed and a lot more.
 


	i'm trying keep amount of functions low, because if that most stuff is packed into one function. 
	Syntax and name of some function might change in future or along suggestions. 
	Not all properties supports every physics element, some are only get, other set only, however most of them are set/get
 


	Current stage:
 


	I already implemented function such a:
 


	
		physics physicsCreateWorld() - responsible for creating new world for simulations, return element which will use later.
	
	
		physics-rigidbody physicsCreateRigidBody( shape-type, mixed arguments ) - creates rigid body which is use to simulation bahaviour of non-static shapes, collisions ( currently only few models in mta can do this in simple way ).
	
	
		physics-rigidbody physicsCreateRigidBodyFromModel( model ) - used to create rigid body directly from collision data taken from gta model.
	
	
		physics-static-collision physicsCreateStaticCollision( shape-type, mixed arguments ) - creates static collision which will not move at all ( it is still possible to move it by Lua script )
	
	
		physics-shape physicsAddShape( shape-type, mixed arguments ) - if you create compound shape, this function let you add more shapes into static collision or rigid body
	
	
		bool physicsSetProperties( any physics element, physics-property, mixed arguments ) - main function to control physics, rigid bodies, static collisions, shapes. Works in simillar way as handling functions.
	
	
		mixed physicsGetProperties( any physics element,  physics-property ) - same as above, but getting properties
	
	
		bool physicsDrawDebug( physics ) - use to visualization of world, must be used in render function
	
	
		bool physicsSetDebugMode( physics-debug-mode, enabled ) - use to turn off/on debugging features
	
	
		bool physicsBuildCollisionFromGTA( physics ) - used to create static collisions in specified world from original collisions, doesn't create whole world instantly, require to move player around world to load collision data.
	
	
		physics-constraint physicsCreateConstraint( physics, physics-rigid-body, physics-rigid-body, constraint-type, mixed arguments ) - use to connecting two or more rigid bodies into one entity
	
	
		bool physicsApplyForce( physics-rigid-body, vector from, vector to ) - pushing rigid body in particular point you choosed.
	
	
		bool physicsApplyCentralForce( physics-rigid-body, vector direction ) - apply force from central position of rigid, it's more like "accelereate", should be used more than once at the some period of time
	
	
		bool physicsApplyCentralImpulse( physics-rigid-body, vector direction ) - setting position from center of rigid
	
	
		bool physicsApplyDamping( physics-rigid-body, float force ) - i'm not sure, but it should slow down velocity and rotation of model by specified amount of units
	
	
		physicsApplyImpulse( physics-rigid-body, vector direction ) - i'm not sure how it works 
	
	
		physicsApplyTorque( physics-rigid-body, vector rotation ) - same as physicsApplyCentralForce but for rotation
	
	
		physicsApplyTorqueImpulse( physics-rigid-body, vector rotation ) - setting rotation speed
	



	physics-properties: "mass", "position" ,"rotation", "sleepingthresholds", "restitution", "scale" "debugcolor", "filtermask", "filtergroup", "stiffness"
 


	`sleepingthresholds` means how slow rigid must move/rotate to sleep, it makes stops moving at all but still can be pushed by other rigids 
	`restitution` bounciness, between 0-1 but accept any value above 
	 
	`stiffness` - for fixed constraint
 


	`filtermask` i still figuring out how it work, but should let you use 32 bit mask to set which rigid with which should collide
 


	Bullet documentation: https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/docs/Bullet_User_Manual.pdf 
	page 13 contains useful information when which shape should be used
 


	physics-constraints: "pointtopoint", "hidge", "fixed", "slider"
 


	Physics-shapes: "box", "sphere", "capsule", "cone", "cylinder",  "heightfieldterrain", "compound", "trianglemesh", "convexhull"
 


	`compound` is used for constructing rigid made of various shapes
 


	Plans for future:
 


	
		"heightfieldterrain" shape type accept black-white texture for faster creation
	
	
		Support for cloths, soft bodies

			O que Ã©? Pra que serve? 
	Um banco de dados Ã© onde ficam salvos diversos tipos de dados que sÃ£o usados entre as sessÃµes dos jogadores e do servidor, isto significa que mesmo se o jogador relogar no servidor ou atÃ© mesmo o servidor reiniciar, os dados salvos no banco de dados nÃ£o sÃ£o perdidos. (se o script que salvou lÃ¡ foi feito corretamente).
 


	O que posso salvar neles? 
	O MTA jÃ¡ cria 2 bancos de dados padrÃ£o quando vc cria seu servidor, sÃ£o eles:
 


		internal.db - Onde sÃ£o salvos todos os dados das contas dos jogadores, login, senha, grana do bolso, posiÃ§Ã£o do jogador quando deslogou, vida, colete, skin, armas, muniÃ§Ã£o, etc.
	
	
		registry.db - Onde sÃ£o salvos todos os dados que sÃ£o utilizados pelos resources, como por exemplo melhores pontuaÃ§Ãµes das corridas (race gamemode), proprietÃ¡rios das casas, dados bancÃ¡rios dos jogadores, saldo bancÃ¡rio dos jogadores, carros comprados pelos jogadores, roupas compradas pelos jogadores, empresas adquiridas pelos jogadores, etc.
	

	Onde eles estÃ£o? 
	Estes dois bancos de dados estÃ£o na pasta deathmatch do seu servidor, estÃ£o na linguagem SQLite. VocÃª ainda pode criar outros bancos de dados externos, para serem usados pelos resources, mas na minha opiniÃ£o isso nÃ£o Ã© recomendÃ¡vel, uma vez que vc usaria MySQL, que Ã© mais complexo e exige certos cuidados de acesso e domÃ­nio, mas alguns servidores profissionais precisam fazer assim pois fizeram os bancos de dados ficarem fora do servidor em outro IP por seguranÃ§a, dai Ã© necessÃ¡rio ter bancos de dados externos. Nesse tutorial vamos tratar somente dos bancos de dados nativos do MTA, por serem mais fÃ¡ceis de entender.
 


	Como mexo neles? 
	Para salvar alguma coisa na conta do jogador, isto Ã©, no internal.db, vocÃª usa setAccountData, e para obter esses dados depois, use getAccountData. Ã extremamente simples, funciona da mesma forma que um setElementData, mas em vez de salvar uma data temporÃ¡ria em um elemento, salva uma data permanente numa conta. 
	PorÃ©m, para salvar alguma coisa no registry.db, Ã© um pouco mais complicado, uma vez que vc vai precisar criar uma tabela nova para cada resource. Por exemplo, vc acabou de criar um resource de ranking por kills/deaths e vocÃª deseja salvar esse ranking no banco de dados para que ao reiniciar o resource ou o servidor, o ranking nÃ£o seja perdido. Para isso vc vai precisar primeiramente criar uma tabela no banco de dados registry.db, essa tabela serÃ¡ acessada pelo resource, que irÃ¡ salvar os dados dele lÃ¡. Para fazer qualquer coisa neste banco de dados (criar tabelas, inserir, alterar, remover, deletar, inserir colunas em determinada tabela, etc) vc vai precisar usar isso: executeSQLQuery. 
	Aqui, serÃ¡ necessÃ¡rio conhecimento em SQL para fazer isso, mas Ã© mais fÃ¡cil do que aprender uma linguagem de programaÃ§Ã£o nova, pois suas opÃ§Ãµes e sintaxes sÃ£o menores do que uma linguagem inteira de programaÃ§Ã£o, vocÃª nÃ£o vai inventar nenhum sistema novo aqui, apenas criar e gerenciar tabelas e dados.
 


		Criar tabela nova no banco de dados: (o Caps Lock nÃ£o Ã© uma regra, mas Ã© melhor para entender o que Ã© cÃ³digo e o que Ã© nome) [Os seguintes cÃ³digos sÃ³ funcionam server-side]

		
executeSQLQuery ("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS nomedatabela (nomecoluna1 TEXT, nomecoluna2 REAL, nomecoluna3 INTEGER)")
		TEXT = Valores desta coluna serÃ£o textos. Podem ter sÃ­mbolos, nÃºmeros e espaÃ§os. 
		REAL = Valores desta coluna serÃ£o numÃ©ricos reais. (nÃºmeros decimais, positivos, negativos e 0.0) 
		INTEGER = Valores desta coluna serÃ£o numÃ©ricos inteiros. (positivos, negativos e 0) 
		(nÃ£o existe tipo BOOLEAN, use TEXT e insira valor "false" ou "true") 
		(existe valor NULL, Ã© diferente de vazio e diferente de 0. NULL significa ausÃªncia de dados. O NULL aparece quando vocÃª cria uma linha ou coluna nova sem atribuir valores a elas.) 
		 
	
	
		Deletar tabela do banco de dados:
		
executeSQLQuery ("DROP TABLE nomedatabela")
		Todas as linhas, colunas, cÃ©lulas e valores desta tabela sÃ£o deletados junto. 
		 
	
	
		Deletar linhas da tabela: (as cÃ©lulas nÃ£o ficarÃ£o NULL)
		
executeSQLQuery ("DELETE FROM nomedatabela WHERE colunaespecÃ­fica=?", valorDaCelulaEspecifica)
		O ? indica que o valor estÃ¡ apÃ³s a declaraÃ§Ã£o do SQL. VocÃª poderia colocar o valor direto no lugar do ?. Mas por alguma razÃ£o, as vezes isso gera erro. AlÃ©m disso, se o valor da cÃ©lula estiver em uma variÃ¡vel no seu script, vocÃª nÃ£o pode declarar a variÃ¡vel no lugar do ?. Ali sÃ³ pode ser o valor direto, pois a declaraÃ§Ã£o SQL inteira se trata de uma string. Por isso o uso do ?, que estÃ¡ recebendo o valor da variÃ¡vel que estÃ¡ depois da vÃ­rgula. 
		Obs: Para verificar se uma cÃ©lula tem valor nulo, nÃ£o se usa os operadores lÃ³gicos de ==, &lt;= &gt;=. Para isso, usa-se IS NULL ou IS NOT NULL. Ex:
		
executeSQLQuery ("DELETE nomecoluna1,nomecoluna2 FROM nomedatabela WHERE nomecoluna3 IS NULL")
		Isso vai deletar todas as cÃ©lulas da coluna 1 e coluna 2 onde a coluna 3 tem uma cÃ©lula de valor NULL. Se a coluna 3 nÃ£o tiver nenhuma cÃ©lula de valor NULL, nada acontece. 
		 
	
	
		Inserir nova linha de valores: (ele vai criar automaticamente uma nova linha com novas cÃ©lulas)
		
executeSQLQuery ("INSERT INTO nomedatabela(nomecoluna1,nomecoluna2,nomecoluna3) VALUES(?,?,?)", valorCelulaColuna1, valorCelulaColuna2, valorCelulaColuna3)
		Neste caso, ele estÃ¡ inserindo 3 novos valores, cada valor em uma coluna. Se vocÃª nÃ£o declarar os nomes das colunas, ele vai preencher na ordem das colunas automaticamente. VocÃª pode deixar de declarar uma coluna se nÃ£o quiser atribuir valor na cÃ©lula daquela coluna. Se o tipo de valor da variÃ¡vel nÃ£o for do tipo de dado daquela coluna, darÃ¡ erro. 
		 
	
	
		Atualizar valores de cÃ©lulas que jÃ¡ existem em uma tabela: (nÃ£o Ã© possÃ­vel alterar os tipos de valores, Ã© necessÃ¡rio editar o tipo da coluna se quiser fazer isso)
		
executeSQLQuery ("UPDATE nomedatabela SET nomecoluna2=?,nomecoluna3=? WHERE nomecoluna1=?", valorCelulaColuna2, valorCelulaColuna3, valorCelulaColuna1)
		No caso acima, ele vai atualizar as cÃ©lulas das colunas 2 e 3 onde o valor da cÃ©lula da coluna 1 for igual ao valor de valorColunaCelula1. OBS: 
		Nada impede que vocÃª coloque as primeiras variÃ¡veis junto Ã  declaraÃ§Ã£o SQL, mas para fazer isso vocÃª deve "cortar" a string, inserir as variÃ¡veis e depois continuar a string, Ex:
		
executeSQLQuery ("UPDATE nomedatabela SET nomecoluna2= '".. valorCelulaColuna2 .."',nomecoluna3='".. valorCelulaColuna2 .."' WHERE nomecoluna1=?", valorCelulaColuna1)
		Lembrando que o valor destas variÃ¡veis tambÃ©m sÃ£o strings na declaraÃ§Ã£o, portanto use aspas simples antes e depois de cada corte para transformar os valores em string. Os dois pontos (..) significam que estes valores fazem parte do argumento SQL. Da mesma forma, se vc usar "1" .. "1", serÃ¡ igual a "11". (Por isso acho muito mais fÃ¡cil deixar tudo ? na declaraÃ§Ã£o SQL e colocar as variÃ¡veis todas apÃ³s a string.) 
		 
	
	
		Selecionar determinadas cÃ©lulas da tabela: (usado geralmente para obter os valores destas cÃ©lulas para usar no script, vocÃª pode selecionar somente 1 cÃ©lula ou vÃ¡rias)
		
executeSQLQuery ("SELECT nomecoluna1,nomecoluna2 FROM nomedatabela WHERE nomecoluna3=?", valorCelulaColuna3)
		Neste exemplo, ele vai selecionar a cÃ©lula da coluna 1 e a cÃ©lula da coluna 2, na linha onde a cÃ©lula da coluna 3 for igual a valorCelulaColuna3. 
		 
	
	
		Alterar a tabela (adicionar coluna nova) [SQLite nÃ£o suporta deletar coluna nem editar tipo de coluna]
		
executeSQLQuery ("ALTER TABLE nomedatabela ADD nomecoluna4 REAL")
		Devido a limitaÃ§Ãµes do SQLite, ALTER TABLE nÃ£o pode ser usado para deletar uma coluna nem para editar seu tipo. Para fazer isso Ã© necessÃ¡rio recriar a tabela inteira com as novas alteraÃ§Ãµes. 
		No exemplo acima, ele vai adicionar uma nova coluna chamada "nomecoluna4".
	

	TÃ¡, mas como ficaria tudo isso dentro de um script? 
	Fiz um cÃ³digo com vÃ¡rios testes de banco de dados. Cada comando faz alguma coisa.
 




	Ã possÃ­vel mexer em um banco de dados manualmente sem usar scripts?
 


	Sim, Ã© possÃ­vel. Eu mesmo costumo fazer isso para corrigir algumas coisas rÃ¡pidas sem precisar programar mais nada. Para poder abrir os bancos de dados (internal.db e registry.db) vocÃª deve usar um programa chamado DB Browser for SQLite. Um programa gratuito, leve e bem fÃ¡cil de entender. Nele vocÃª consegue acessar todas as tabelas do banco de dados e editar os valores como se fosse em uma planilha do Excel. Basta ir na aba Navegar dados, selecionar a tabela que deseja modificar, clicar em cima da cÃ©lula cujo valor deseja atualizar, digitar o novo valor, clicar em Aplicar e depois clicar em Escrever modificaÃ§Ãµes (salvar banco de dados). Pronto! 
	E tem mais! Se vocÃª jÃ¡ tiver conhecimento avanÃ§ado com a linguagem SQL, vocÃª tambÃ©m pode fazer alteraÃ§Ãµes avanÃ§adas via cÃ³digo dentro do programa. Basta acessar a aba Executar SQL, escrever o comando SQL corretamente e depois clicar no botÃ£o de Play.
 


	Espero ter ajudado.

			Introduction
 


	Properly handling your user's credentials (username and password) is very important, this guide gives detailed information and code samples on how to (properly) implement an account "system". This guide assumes you are not using MTA's built in accounts. 
 


	Disclaimer: Any code shown in this tutorial is purely for illustrative purposes, and is not finished code, you should use it as a guideline, not a solution.
 


	Content
 


	The following topics will be discussed in this tutorial:
 


	
		How to hash and salt passwords (register)
	
	
		How to validate a hashed password (login)
	
	
		How to add "remember-me" functionality
	
	
		How to offer password recovery
	
	
		How to migrate from an older hashing algorithm, to a newer one
	
	
		Using a password policy
	
	
		(Extra) How to handle database leaks
	
	
		(Extra) What even is hashing and salting?
	



	For the purpose of this tutorial we expect a database structure which is somewhat similar to this:
 


	
 


	How to hash and salt passwords 
	When you have a user register on your service, that user expects of you to keep their password safe. Whilst it is generally bad practice to use the same password for multiple services there are many users that still do so. Because of this it's crucial that you save the user's passwords in a way that an attacker will be unable to find out the original password the user typed. This includes if they have full access to your database. In order to do this we do what is called "Password hashing"
 


	When a user registers, your server receives the user's intended username, (email) and password. Before you save that password to the database you have to hash and salt this, luckily MTA has a function that takes care of this. If you wish to know more about what exactly it does, there's more information at the end of this tutorial. 
 


	In order to hash this password you use the passwordHash function. This function is relatively slow (by design), so it is highly recommended you pass a callback to this function, so your entire script doesn't wait for it to complete.
 


	https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/PasswordHash
 


local mysqlHandle -- we're assuming this value is set somewhere else in code

function register(username, email, password)
    local player = client

    passwordHash(password, "bcrypt", {}, function(hashedPassword)
        -- callback function for hashing the password
        local handle = dbQuery(function(handle) 
            -- callback function for storing the user in the database
            if (handle) then
                triggerClientEvent(player, "registrationSuccess") -- inform the user that registration was successful
            else
                triggerClientEvent(player, "registrationFailed")
            end
        end,mysqlHandle, "INSERT INTO users (email, username, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", email, username, hashedPassword)

    end)

end
addEvent("passwordTutorial:register", true)
addEventHandler("passwordTutorial:register", getRootElement(), register)


	 
 


	How to validate a hashed password 
	Once you've saved the hashed password to your database you need to do a little bit of additional work when authenticating the user. Luckily MTA offers a passwordVerify() function, which is the counterpart of the previously discussed passwordHash(). What this function does it basically hashes the password in the same way, resulting in the same output hash.
 


	https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/passwordVerify
 


	In order to get the account the user is trying to log in to you have to do a query for an account which has the user submitted username, and of which the password matches through passwordVerify. PasswordVerify is also a relatively slow function, thus you should use a callback.
 


	 
 


function login(username, password)
    local player = client

    dbQuery(function (handle)
        -- callback for the query selecting the user by username
        local results = dbPoll(handle, -1)
        if (#results == 0) then
            triggerClientEvent(player, "loginFailed")
            return
        end

        passwordVerify(password, results[1].password, {}, function(matches)
            -- callback function for the password verify
            if (matches) then
                -- Do anything you wish with the database result to log the player in with the rest of your scripts
                triggerClientEvent(player, "loginSuccess")
            else
                triggerClientEvent(player, "loginFailed")
            end
        end)

    end, mysqlHandle, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username)
end
addEvent("passwordTutorial:login", true)
addEventHandler("passwordTutorial:login", getRootElement(), login)


	 
 


	How to add "remember me" functionality 
	When users on your server log in, they often do not want to have to enter their username and password every time they want to log in. In order to satisfy this need you can implement a "remember me" function. What I've seen happen in the past, is people would store the user's password (encrypted) on the client. This is NOT safe, and should never be done!
 


	In order to properly use remember me functionality what you would do is upon login in, generate a random string. The longer the better. This random string is what we call an access token. You would then allow the user to log in with such an access token, preferably only once generating a new access token each time one is used.
 


	To implement this you would generate that token every time the user logs in, whilst they have "remember me" enabled. You will have to save this token in your database alongside your user.  For extra security you could also store the user's serial alongside the access token, you can then validate that the access token is being used from the same device.
 


	https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Filepath
 


function login(username, password)
    -- This code should be put in the callback to the dbQuery function, but to keep the example clean that's not shown here
    if (rememberMe) then
        local token = generateRandomToken()
        dbQuery(mysqlHandle, "INSERT INTO access_tokens (user_id, token) VALUES (?, ?)", results[1].id, token)
        triggerClientEvent(player, "loginSuccess", token)
    end
end

function rememberMeLogin(username, accessToken)
    -- this function handles a user's login attempt 
    dbQuery(function(handle)
        local result = dbPoll(handle, -1)
        if (#result == 0) then
            triggerClientEvent(player, "loginFailed")
        else
            -- Do anything you wish with the database result to log the player in with the rest of your scripts
            triggerClientEvent(player, "loginSuccess")
        end
    end,mysqlHandle, "SELECT users.* FROM access_tokens JOIN users ON users.id = access_tokens.user_id WHERE users.username = ?", username)
end
addEvent("passwordTutorial:loginRememberMe", true)
addEventHandler("passwordTutorial:loginRememberMe", getRootElement(), login)


	How to offer password recovery 
	Offering password recovery requires a little bit more than just your MTA server. Generally password recovery is done with emails. So you would need access to an email server / service which you can use to send an email from an HTTP request. (Like you can do with fetchRemote()). 
 


	When a user requests a password reset, have them enter the email you registered with. You then fetch a user from the database with this email address. You would then store a password recovery token for this user. This token, just like the remember me token, is a random string. 
 


	Ideally, you would send the user a link with a password reset form that goes to a webpage where the user can reset their password. You could do this with an external service, like a webserver. Or you could use MTA's Resource web access for it, but if you do make sure you handle permissions properly for anything else that uses this. However another option would be to have the user copy paste the generated token from the email into you server's login window. 
 


	Which of the two solutions you pick is up to you, my personal preference goes to the one with the link in the email. But in either case the server side logic is the same.
 


	When the user attempts to perform password recovery, verify that the token they give you belongs to a user, and then change the password to the newly requested password. Make sure you hash this password the same way you do in your login.
 


function requestPasswordRecovery(email)
    dbQuery(function (handle))
        local result = dbPoll(handle, -1)
        if (#result == 0) then
            triggerClientEvent(player, "passwordTutorial:passwordRecoveryRequestFailed")
        else
            local token = generateRandomToken()
            dbExec(mysqlHandle, "UPDATE user_data SET recovery_token = ?", token)
            -- mail the token to the user, mail implementation depends on the mail server/service you use
            triggerClientEvent(player, "passwordTutorial:passwordRecoveryRequestSuccess")
        end
    end, mysqlHandle, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?", email)
end

function recoverPassword(recoveryToken, password)
    dbQuery(function (handle)
        local result = dbPoll(handle, -1)
        if (#result == 0) then
            -- this is only valid if you have the user request password recovery from ingame
            triggerClientEvent(player, "passwordTutorial:passwordRecoveryFailed")
        else

            passwordHash(password, "bcrypt", {}, function(hashedPassword)
                -- callback function for hashing the password
                local handle = dbExec(function(handle) 
                    -- callback function for storing the new password in the database
                    if (handle) then
                        -- this is only valid if you have the user request password recovery from ingame
                        triggerClientEvent(player, "passwordTutorial:passwordRecoverySuccess") -- inform the user that registration was successful
                    else
                        -- this is only valid if you have the user request password recovery from ingame
                        triggerClientEvent(player, "passwordTutorial:passwordRecoveryFailed")
                    end
                end,mysqlHandle, "UPDATE user_data SET password = ? WHERE recovery_token = ?", username, recoveryToken)
        
            end)

        end
    end, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE recovery_token = ?", recoveryToken)
end


	Besides changing the password, it's important you also delete any access tokens that user might have if you're using remember me functionality. 
	It is also good practice to make recovery tokens expiry after a certain amount of times, and not allow a recovery token to be created whilst one is already in progress. This prevents a user from sending a large number of emails from your service.
 


	 
	How to migrate from an older hashing algorithm, to a newer one 
	Maybe after reading this topic you realise that your password security is not what it should be. So you want to change your old password hashing / validation logic to the ones explained in this topic. And due to the nature that hashes can not be "unhashed", you can't simply migrate your passwords over. So in order to migrate the passwords what you have to do is when a user logs in, first validate their password with the old hashing algorithm. If this matches, then hash (and salt) it with your new hashing algorithm and save it in your database. Make sure to delete the old password otherwise your password security is not any better than before.
 


	Using a password policy 
	Passwords policies are important to prevent your users from picking a password that is too easily cracked / brute forced. Many password policies come in the form of "Must have at least one capital letter, one digit and one number". But that discards that fact that the best way to make your password more difficult to crack, is making your password longer. So in the code snippet below is a function that measures the 'search space' of a password. The search space of a password is the amount of possible passwords there are with a certain combination of characters.
 


	In order to use this, you would have to set a minimum password search space when a user registers for an account. This minimum is up for you to set, but be reasonable, you shouldn't expect a user's password to be impossible to remember / create. I recommend playing with the function a bit to see what values you get out of it, and pick something you believe is sensible.
 


function getPasswordSearchSpace(password)
    local lowerCase = password:find("%l") and 26 or 0
    local upperCase = password:find("%u") and 26 or 0
    local digits = password:find("%d") and 10 or 0
    local symbols = password:find("%W") and 32 or 0
    local length = password:len()

    return (lowerCase + upperCase + digits + symbols) ^ length
end

-- The below function calls are to indicate the difference in search space for a set of passwords
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("a"))
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("abc"))
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("Abc"))
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("Ab!"))
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("Ab!0"))

print(getPasswordSearchSpace("Mu#9A0h."))
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("This is a demonstration of how easy an incredibly strong password is to remember"))


	 
 


	How to handle database leaks 
	If you have reason to believe that your database has been leaked or otherwise compromised, it is important that your first course of action is removing any access tokens stored in your database. Once you have done that you have to inform your users. Whilst when properly hashed and salted it's extremely difficult / time consuming to find out a user's password it is still a possibility. So you should inform your users of the breach, tell them that their passwords were properly hashed, and they do not need to fear for their passwords immediately. However you should suggest to your users that they change their password either way, just in case.
 


	What even is hashing and salting? 
	Hashing has been brought up several times in this tutorial, whilst you do not need to know what it is / does, you might be interested in knowing regardless. I won't be going too far in depth as I simply do not have the knowledge, but the basic idea of hashing is this:
 


	When you hash anything, you turn it into a string of characters (or other value) that has no relation to the original input, other than when you hash the original input again, it will always generate the same hash. 
	For example, when you hash the string 'banana' using the sha512 hashing algorithm, it will always yield the output: "F8E3183D38E6C51889582CB260AB825252F395B4AC8FB0E6B13E9A71F7C10A80D5301E4A949F2783CB0C20205F1D850F87045F4420AD2271C8FD5F0CD8944BE3"
 


	Now hashing can not be reverted, you can not "unhash" a hash, so in order to verify someone's password you hash it again, and see if the two hashes are the exact same. Now this is great, passwords are safely stored. However there is still more to do, salting.
 


	Salting is adding some random data to your password prior to hashing it. This prevents when two users (on the same service, or on others) have the same password, that their hashes are also the same. Meaning if one password is compromised, the other password is not. It is important that a salt is random for every user in your application, not one salt for your entire application.
 


	Now you might think we didn't do any salting in the code / tutorial above. This is not true, we just didn't do it ourselves. MTA's passwordHash function actually hashes the passwords and salts it, this salt is then stored in the output hash it self, just before the actual password hash. In the case of bcrypt it actually stores a little bit more info in the resulting hash, but you need not worry about that.

			Hello there! 
	You found Dystopia: The Incident, 
	an original sandbox post-apocalyptic RPG. 
	Keep reading below and youâll find out more...
 


	Test server:  mtasa://46.105.109.59:22008
 


	
 


	Discord: https://discord.gg/Zs5bWSX
 


	Current version: alpha 0.75, check out details here DOWNLOAD (0.75 alpha)
 


	 


	Key concepts
 


	Food and water are scarce and you need to be on the move to stay alive. Inventory size is limited, forcing you to prioritize. Vehicles require constant maintenance. Faction camps, bases, shanty towns and other encounter zones all over San Andreas. Exploration is rewarded. World is densely populated with NPCs and who you choose to kill matters. Environment is harsh and punishes the weak and the dumb. Moral decisions to be made. End goal. Roleplay friendly. Designed to be also enjoyable as a single-player experience. 
 


	 


	Setting
 


	2000: A series of catastrophic earthquakes smashed the cities and countryside of San Andreas. In the aftermath, the whole state found itself separated from mainland. Fear and selfishness roamed free, pushing society into chaos. In the heart of San Fierro, one of the largest cities of San Andreas, government-sponsored Zombotech Corporation was researching biological weapons in its underground facility. The labs were heavily damaged by the cataclysm and a deadly infectious agent escaped in the streets. While emergency services struggled to contain the disaster and minimize collateral damage, death was spreading unnoticed. 2001: The Establishment evacuated survivors of the outbreak in the barricaded city of Las Venturas but infection spread inside the fence. They nuked the city and placed San Andreas under strict military quarantine. Nobody gets in, nobody gets out. They dubbed the disaster âThe Incidentâ to minimize its amplitude, media soon went silent and survivors were forgotten. 2007: 6 years passed and things have not become better. Regular people picked things up from where the government left them and started to organize. This is a tough new world, populated with the full spectrum of humanity: resilient survivors, vicious bandits, cannibalistic raiders, oppressive military forces and the rest of the loons. No line between good and bad was ever so ill-defined.
 


	  


	  


	San Andreas is ruled with an iron hand by Governor Skinner, who took office only six days after the Incident. His armed forces fight to control the territory, herding men into the new Refugee Camp. Resources are scarce and many dropped the last remnants of morality when they faced starvation. Violent clans and factions fight over the remains, establishing turfs or just trying to stay alive. Militias fight for supremacy, idealists work to maintain civilization and everybody else just struggles to survive another day in an increasingly suffocating world. As it became evident that the government has no rescue plan for them, despair started to crumble the minds of the few sane left. All attempts to flee San Andreas are met with airstrikes. But there must be ways to escape this place...
 


	What you can experience right now
 


	Explore a detailed post-apocalyptic map with many encounter zones. Plenty of NPCs, both friendlies and baddies. Dynamic faction and spawn system. More than 40 missions already in the game. Detailed inventory with more than 100 items to be found and used. Basic needs, stamina, infection, various other modifiers like pain, bleeding, exhaustion or inebriation. Innovative looting mechanic. Four zombie types, with different behavior. Scavenge the world for materials to build settlements or to use simple crafting and cooking. Upgrade and drive rugged vehicles across the wasteland and engage in vehicular combat. Trade, recruit and discover parts of the story by chatting with NPCs. Experience dark humor and some strong themes (16+). Simple interface, consistent graphic style.
 


	  


	  


	What still needs to be done
 


	The current gamemode version is alpha 0.75. Required for beta: skills and abilities implementation, npc traffic, karma system and map completion (now &gt;90%). Once the project hits beta and the core is completed weâll start focusing exclusively on the missions and story. 
 


	Seeking friends for the end of the world 
 


	Want to jump onboard and take part in the development? Great, join our Discord server using the link on top (the recommended approach) or PM me here. We're always looking for like-minded developers. Wanted: scripters, mappers, storytellers, 3D artists and testers.

	I'm here releasing a new Arabic-translated admin panel from today's version (september 2017) after I noticed all community circulating AR panels were outdated as hell. As they pose serious security risks, eventhough I'm not Arabic, I felt it of such importance that I've spent a long time transferring translations from older circulating panels to this most up-to-date Admin panel. I'm helping a huge amount of server owners with this, because most will just use a Community version that is outdated because of the great time to invest in translating yourself. Ofcourse, you'll also benefit from new features and updates made to Admin recently, (look here: https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-resources/commits/master/[admin]) both for this reason and security I advise you inform all server owners you know about this release and suggest they update if they're using Arab panels.
 


	If you spot any translation issues, please leave a reply.

			Hey folks
 


	So, I joined this community back in 2008, when MTA SA DM DP1 was released. It was great. I played in servers. I scripted stuff. The scripting part is especially important here, because I was amazed to see what possibilities to customize the game MTA SA gives to the scripters, and that's what got me involved so much. It was by scripting on MTA that I got lots of coding experience. I had such a great time that 2008 was one of the most memorable years for me, because I can still remember the good moments, including my first time playing the non-race version (I played MTA SA Race in 2007, but only a little bit, and didn't think much of it) and my first attempts to script.
 


	As time went by, I set goals for myself. I thought of making my own server with my own gamemode. I didn't just want it for my own gains, I wanted it for the good of MTA, too! I wanted to make use of MTA scripting possibilities, to let the greatness of MTA be known! However, as I still wasn't that good at scripting nor at setting goals (they were huge), I wasn't exactly being productive. I experimented a lot and learned a lot, but apart from that, it didn't really go anywhere. After a few years of playing around, I realized my goals weren't going to come true. I decided I just wanted to be useful to MTA community. That's when I made and released a few scripts, including Drawtag, Gravity gun and NPC traffic. Later I made my own server after all, with a gamemode very different from what I had originally planned. But I was too busy with crap in my life to continue working on it, so I had to end it. I didn't want to abandon MTA. All those dreams that never came true. But I didn't see any other way. I stopped playing and scripting on MTA. Eventually I drifted away and stopped visiting this forum altogether.
 


	During the time I was away, I was just living life, but not really feeling like I was enjoying it. There were ups and downs. You know, everyone goes through different phases of life.
 


	But now I feel bad about it. It wasn't necessarily my fault that I left, but it was my fault that I didn't come back for so long. Now that I finally did, it seems there have been people who were looking for me, but I don't even know if it's of any use to reply to messages I received 3 to 5 years ago. I'm regularly on YouTube though, but even there, often I didn't feel like replying to comments right away and forgot about them later. I'm feeling like a busta who ran away and left his homies when there was no reason to. I'm feeling like I have betrayed MTA because it gave me so much, but I didn't manage to benefit it as much as I thought it deserved.
 


	Things have surely changed around here while I was gone. I see there are admins and moderators who weren't even on this forum when I left. And honestly, I don't remember many people in particular. I don't remember well who was and who wasn't here back in those days. I don't know if anyone here misses me. I'm so out of touch. Kinda sucks, doesn't it? After wandering for years, I'm finally back home, but I'm not even sure if it's still the same home that I've been missing because I don't even know if people here are still the same people that I left. But I see some usernames that look familiar and I can take comfort in that.
 


	MTA seems to be doing much better than before. I didn't expect it to become so popular! I'm supposed to be happy about this, because it was my dream to see MTA achieve the popularity that it deserves. But it feels like yet another thing I missed out on. I wasn't a part of MTA community during the time that it grew so much. What a shame.
 


	Unfortunately, I don't have plans to resume MTA scripting, not big ones at least. It's a pity, seeing how MTA now has scripting features that I used to dream of. But I just don't think I currently can focus on it. Still, it feels tempting to try. I'm curious, how much have peds been improved? In the old days, I would run into problems because the peds would lose information about health, ammo and many other things, when they got streamed out, so I couldn't have them properly synced and had to resort to workarounds. What about model/texture replacing? I see there are some new related functions, so this functionality must have been improved, right? I remember trying to import Liberty City and Vice City back in 2010, and I managed to convert Liberty City, but I couldn't load it all at once, because 512 MB of RAM was not enough to replace that many models at the same time. And replacing the models dynamically (based on distance to the player) wasn't working well, there were bugs and some models weren't actually getting replaced.
 


	My scripts website is no longer there. I still have the files, but I see someone made a GitHub repository and uploaded the resources there, so I guess it's okay as it is. The resources are available to everyone and I'm thankful for that. If I ever decided to make scripts for the community to use, I would start from scratch rather than continue working on the old ones. The same can be said about the server I had, I have the gamemode and the database, but if I wanted to run a server again, I would start the gamemode all over.
 


	While the future of my involvement in MTA scripting is uncertain, I'm seeking to be active on this forum once again. I want to be in touch with MTA and the community. Maybe I should try helping people in scripting section or something like that. Perhaps make some tutorial. I'm much better at programming than I used to be. I'm working on my own game engine, but I don't want to make it sound like I'm doing something big or anything like that. This is another thing that I took my time to play around with. I started it long ago, I learned a lot, but I have little results. Either way, it was MTA that inspired me to do it. And I have an idea to make a common scripting interface for MTA and my engine so that scripts made using this interface would work on both. Not stating that's what's going to happen, I'm just thinking of ways to make scripts for MTA even when I have to focus on something else.
 


	With things I learned in the recent years, some MTA script ideas that I once considered difficult to implement, look much easier now. Hell, even if I made the mistake of leaving MTA for so long, these years were still far from wasted.
 


	That's pretty much all I wanted to say for now. I left for several years, now I feel bad about it, "but now I'm back, and I know what I've been missing". Not sure how much I'm going to be involved in MTA scripting, if at all, but I just want to be a part of this community again.

			Hi!
 


	Following the community discussion in our forums, we have created an official Discord server quite a while ago, as an alternative (and maybe a full replacement in the future) to our current IRC channels. We kept it in under the radar while we were fine tuning things, but we believe we can now present it to you guys. All MTA players and fans are welcome to join our Discord server (though please behave while you are in there ).
 


	You can join it by using this link: https://discord.gg/mtasa
 


	 
	What is Discord?
 


	Discord is a hybrid of IRC, an Instant Messenger and a Voice Chat software. It incorporates the most important features of these elements into a handy and multiplatform app which you can run on your desktops, smartphones or tablets.
 


	 
	Why is it cool?
 


	Compared to IRC, it offers a built-in chat history buffer, so even if you are offline, you can still catch up with what happened in the channels then. IRC also offers that, but only through an IRC Bouncer that you either need to pay for, or have someone host it for you. 
	It also has a modern look and features such as URL embedding (regular websites, but also pictures and videos), handy syntax colouring for pasted code snippets, emojis (also custom ones), chat messages reactions, Steam integration and more.
 


	 
	What can I find while I am there?
 


	We currently have some channels created, including:
 


	
		#general - for general MTA and offtopic chats
	
	
		#scripting - for Lua scripting-related queries
	
	
		#support - for any problems related to MTA:SA client or server
	
	
		#announcements - for all important messages from us
	



	as well as some others. We are still thinking of how to put our Discord server into its full potential, so we may add more channels soon.
 


	 
	Can I have Discord app installed and/or running on several of my devices concurrently? Can I use more than one server?
 


	Sure, absolutely. It will sync the messages automatically. And yes, you can add more servers than just our one.
 


	 
	How do I join it?
 


	Hey, we have mentioned that already. Just click the link below and follow the instructions: 
	https://discord.gg/mtasa
 


	 
	I have a suggestion about the Discord...
 


	Okay, let us know. As usual, we are open for suggestions. Just post in this topic or hit us up directly on Discord.
 


	 
	Hope to see you there! 
	-- MTA Team

			After a worrying discussion on Discord last night regarding password storage and remember me functionality I've decided to write a tutorial on how it should be done. This guide assumes you are not using MTA's built in account system, but a custom one.  Any code shown in this tutorial is purely for illustrative purposes, and is not finished code, you should use it as a guideline, not a solution.
 


	The following topics will be discussed in this tutorial:
 


	
		How to hash and salt passwords (register)
	
	
		How to validate a hashed password (login)
	
	
		How to add "remember-me" functionality
	
	
		How to offer password recovery
	
	
		How to migrate from an older hashing algorithm, to a newer one
	
	
		Using a password policy
	
	
		(Extra) How to handle database leaks
	
	
		(Extra) What even is hashing and salting?
	



	For the purpose of this tutorial we expect a database structure which is somewhat similar to this:
 


	
 


	How to hash and salt passwords 
	When you have a user register on your service, that user expects of you to keep their password safe. Whilst it is generally bad practice to use the same password for multiple services there are many users that still do so. Because of this it's crucial that you save the user's passwords in a way that an attacker will be unable to find out the original password the user typed. This includes if they have full access to your database. In order to do this we do what is called "Password hashing"
 


	When a user registers, your server receives the user's intended username, (email) and password. Before you save that password to the database you have to hash and salt this, luckily MTA has a function that takes care of this. If you wish to know more about what exactly it does, there's more information at the end of this tutorial. 
 


	In order to hash this password you use the passwordHash function. This function is relatively slow (by design), so it is highly recommended you pass a callback to this function, so your entire script doesn't wait for it to complete.
 


	https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/PasswordHash
 


local mysqlHandle -- we're assuming this value is set somewhere else in code

function register(username, email, password)
    local player = client

    passwordHash(password, "bcrypt", {}, function(hashedPassword)
        -- callback function for hashing the password
        local handle = dbExec(function(handle) 
            -- callback function for storing the user in the database
            if (handle) then
                triggerClientEvent(player, "registrationSuccess") -- inform the user that registration was successful
            else
                triggerClientEvent(player, "registrationFailed")
            end
        end,mysqlHandle, "INSERT INTO users (email, username, password) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", email, username, hashedPassword)

    end)

end
addEvent("passwordTutorial:register", true)
addEventHandler("passwordTutorial:register", getRootElement(), register)


	 
 


	How to validate a hashed password 
	Once you've saved the hashed pasword to your database you need to do a little bit of additional work when authenticating the user. Luckily MTA offers a passwordVerify() function, which is the counterpart of the previously discussed passwordHash(). What this function does it basically hashes the password in the same way, resulting in the same output hash.
 


	https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/passwordVerify
 


	In order to get the account the user is trying to log in to you have to do a query for an account which has the user submitted username, and of which the password matches through passwordVerify. PasswordVerify is also a relatively slow function, thus you should use a callback.
 


	 
 


function login(username, password)
    local player = client

    dbQuery(function (handle)
        -- callback for the query selecting the user by username
        local results = dbPoll(handle, -1)
        if (#results == 0) then
            triggerClientEvent(player, "loginFailed")
            return
        end

        passwordVerify(password, results[1].password, {}, function(matches)
            -- callback function for the password verify
            if (matches) then
                -- Do anything you wish with the database result to log the player in with the rest of your scripts
                triggerClientEvent(player, "loginSuccess")
            else
                triggerClientEvent(player, "loginFailed")
            end
        end)

    end, mysqlHandle, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?", username)
end
addEvent("passwordTutorial:login", true)
addEventHandler("passwordTutorial:login", getRootElement(), login)


	 
 


	How to add "remember me" functionality 
	When users on your server log in, they often do not want to have to enter their username and password every time they want to log in. In order to satisfy this need you can implement a "remember me" function. What I've seen happen in the past, is people would store the user's password (encrypted) on the client. This is NOT safe, and should never be done!
 


	In order to properly use remember me functionality what you would do is upon login in, generate a random string. The longer the better. This random string is what we call an access token. You would then allow the user to log in with such an access token, preferably only once generating a new access token each time one is used.
 


	To implement this you would generate that token every time the user logs in, whilst they have "remember me" enabled. You will have to save this token in your database alongside your user.  For extra security you could also store the user's serial alongside the access token, you can then validate that the access token is being used from the same device.
 


	https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Filepath
 


function login(username, password)
    -- This code should be put in the callback to the dbQuery function, but to keep the example clean that's not shown here
    if (rememberMe) then
        local token = generateRandomToken()
        dbExec(function() 
            triggerClientEvent(player, "loginSuccess", token)
        end,mysqlHandle, "INSERT INTO access_tokens (user_id, token) VALUES (?, ?)", results[1].id, token)
    end
end

function rememberMeLogin(username, accessToken)
    -- this function handles a user's login attempt 
    dbQuery(function(handle)
        local result = dbPoll(handle, -1)
        if (#result == 0) then
            triggerClientEvent(player, "loginFailed")
        else
            -- Do anything you wish with the database result to log the player in with the rest of your scripts
            triggerClientEvent(player, "loginSuccess")
        end
    end,mysqlHandle, "SELECT users.* FROM access_tokens JOIN users ON users.id = access_tokens.user_id WHERE users.username = ?", username)
end
addEvent("passwordTutorial:loginRememberMe", true)

	How to offer password recovery 
	Offering password recovery requires a little bit more than just your MTA server. Generally password recovery is done with emails. So you would need access to an email server / service which you can use to send an email from an HTTP request. (Like you can do with fetchRemote()). 
 


	When a user requests a password reset, have them enter the email you registered with. You then fetch a user from the database with this email address. You would then store a password recovery token for this user. This token, just like the remember me token, is a random string. 
 


	Ideally, you would send the user a link with a password reset form that goes to a webpage where the user can reset their password. You could do this with an external service, like a webserver. Or you could use MTA's Resource web access for it, but if you do make sure you handle permissions properly for anything else that uses this. However another option would be to have the user copy paste the generated token from the email into you server's login window. 
 


	Which of the two solutions you pick is up to you, my personal preference goes to the one with the link in the email. But in either case the server side logic is the same.
 


	When the user attempts to perform password recovery, verify that the token they give you belongs to a user, and then change the password to the newly requested password. Make sure you hash this password the same way you do in your login.
 


function requestPasswordRecovery(email)
    dbQuery(function (handle))
        local result = dbPoll(handle, -1)
        if (#result == 0) then
            triggerClientEvent(player, "passwordTutorial:passwordRecoveryRequestFailed")
        else
            local token = generateRandomToken()
            dbExec(mysqlHandle, "UPDATE user_data SET recovery_token = ?", token)
            -- mail the token to the user, mail implementation depends on the mail server/service you use
            triggerClientEvent(player, "passwordTutorial:passwordRecoveryRequestSuccess")
        end
    end, mysqlHandle, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?", email)
end

function recoverPassword(recoveryToken, password)
    dbQuery(function (handle)
        local result = dbPoll(handle, -1)
        if (#result == 0) then
            -- this is only valid if you have the user request password recovery from ingame
            triggerClientEvent(player, "passwordTutorial:passwordRecoveryFailed")
        else

            passwordHash(password, "bcrypt", {}, function(hashedPassword)
                -- callback function for hashing the password
                local handle = dbExec(function(handle) 
                    -- callback function for storing the new password in the database
                    if (handle) then
                        -- this is only valid if you have the user request password recovery from ingame
                        triggerClientEvent(player, "passwordTutorial:passwordRecoverySuccess") -- inform the user that registration was successful
                    else
                        -- this is only valid if you have the user request password recovery from ingame
                        triggerClientEvent(player, "passwordTutorial:passwordRecoveryFailed")
                    end
                end,mysqlHandle, "UPDATE user_data SET password = ? WHERE recovery_token = ?", username, recoveryToken)
        
            end)

        end
    end, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE recovery_token = ?", recoveryToken)
end


	Besides changing the password, it's important you also delete any access tokens that user might have if you're using remember me functionality. 
	It is also good practice to make recovery tokens expiry after a certain amount of times, and not allow a recovery token to be created whilst one is already in prgoress. This prevents a user from sending a large number of emails from your service.
 


	 
	How to migrate from an older hashing algorithm, to a newer one 
	Maybe after reading this topic you realise that your password security is not what it should be. So you want to change your old password hashing / validation logic to the ones explained in this topic. And due to the nature that hashes can not be "unhashed", you can't simply migrate your passwords over. So in order to migrate the passwords what you have to do is when a user logs in, first validate their password with the old hashing algorithm. If this matches, then hash (and salt) it with your new hashing algorithm and save it in your database. Make sure to delete the old password otherwise your password security is not any better than before.
 


	Using a password policy 
	Passwords policies are important to prevent your users from picking a password that is too easily cracked / brute forced. Many password policies come in the form of "Must have at least one capital letter, one digit and one number". But that discards that fact that the best way to make your password more difficult to crack, is making your password longer. So in the code snippet below is a function that measures the 'search space' of a password. The search space of a password is the amount of possible passwords there are with a certain combination of characters.
 


	In order to use this, you would have to set a minimum password search space when a user registers for an account. This minimum is up for you to set, but be reasonable, you shouldn't expect a user's password to be impossible to remember / create. I recomend playing with the function a bit to see what values you get out of it, and pick something you believe is sensible.
 


function getPasswordSearchSpace(password)
    local lowerCase = password:find("%l") and 26 or 0
    local upperCase = password:find("%u") and 26 or 0
    local digits = password:find("%d") and 10 or 0
    local symbols = password:find("%W") and 32 or 0
    local length = password:len()

    return (lowerCase + upperCase + digits + symbols) ^ length
end

-- The below function calls are to indicate the difference in search space for a set of passwords
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("a"))
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("abc"))
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("Abc"))
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("Ab!"))
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("Ab!0"))

print(getPasswordSearchSpace("Mu#9A0h."))
print(getPasswordSearchSpace("This is a demonstration of how easy an incredibly strong password is to remember"))


	 
 


	How to handle database leaks 
	If you have reason to believe that your database has been leaked or otherwise compromised, it is important that your first course of action is removing any access tokens stored in your database. Once you have done that you have to inform your users. Whilst when properly hashed and salted it's extremely difficult / time consuming to find out a user's password it is still a possibilty. So you should inform your users of the breach, tell them that their passwords were properly hashed, and they do not need to fear for their passwords immediately. However you should suggest to your users that they change their password either way, just in case.
 


	What even is hashing and salting? 
	Hashing has been brought up several times in this tutorial, whilst you do not need to know what it is / does, you might be interested in knowing regardless. I won't be going too far in depth as I simply do not have the knowledge, but the basic idea of hashing is this:
 


	When you hash anything, you turn it into a string of characters (or other value) that has no relation to the original input, other than when you hash the original input again, it will always generate the same hash. 
	For example, when you hash the stirng 'banana' using the sha512 hashing algorithm, it will always yield the output: "F8E3183D38E6C51889582CB260AB825252F395B4AC8FB0E6B13E9A71F7C10A80D5301E4A949F2783CB0C20205F1D850F87045F4420AD2271C8FD5F0CD8944BE3"
 


	Now hashing can not be reverted, you can not "unhash" a hash, so in order to verify someone's password you hash it again, and see if the two hashes are the exact same. Now this is great, passwords are safely stored. However there is still more to do, salting.
 


	Salting is adding some random data to your password prior to hashing it. This prevents when two users (on the same service, or on others) have the same password, that their hashes are also the same. Meaning if one password is compromised, the other password is not. It is important that a salt is random for every user in your application, not one salt for your entire application.
 


	Now you might think we didn't do any salting in the code / tutorial above. This is not true, we just didn't do it ourselves. MTA's passwordHash function actually hashes the passwords and salts it, this salt is then stored in the output hash it self, just before the actual password hash. In the case of bcrypt it actually stores a little bit more info in the resulting hash, but you need not worry about that.

			Debugging
 


	Do you know what debugging is?
 


	You might think you do, but unfortunately (in my opinion) only ~15% of the scripters in the community do know the full definition of it.
 


	Many people think that debugging code is the same as looking in to the Debug Console and waiting for warning + errors to show up. That's indeed debugging and yet it never provide all information you need to build your scripts. It only can say what goes wrong at a certain line. With other words, the Debug Console by default will only show a limited amount of mistakes you have made in your code.
 


	 
 


	So what is next? You fixed all warnings and errors and yet it doesn't work.
 


		You start with making your code visible!
	

	 
 


	I guess 70% would think: Making code visible? Ehhh how???
 


	 
 


	Let me write it down a little bit different:
 


		By using Debug Information making the behaviour of the code visible.
	

	 
 


	I guess 50% would think: Eh what? behaviour of code?????
 


	 
 


	Let me give you an example.
 


	
		 
	 

	


	 
 


	Example: (1)
 


outputDebugString("the script has started") -- &lt; this is a debug line

if true then 
	outputDebugString("code works here")  -- &lt; this is a debug line
else 
	outputDebugString("code shouldn't be working here")  -- &lt; this is a debug line
end


	 
 


	Debug console
 


"the script has started"
"code works here"


	 
 


	The debug console is NOT information for players, it is information for YOU developers!
 


	 
 


	BTW this is a debug line
 


outputDebugString("test")  -- &lt; this is a debug line


	In this case it is just a piece of code that shows information in the debug console.
 


	 
 


	


	 
 


	Example: (2)
 


local playerName1 = "snake1" 
local playerName2 = "cow" 
if playerName1 == playerName2 then
	outputDebugString("players playerName1 and playerName2 do share the same name. Name: " .. tostring(playerName1))  -- &lt; this is a debug line
else 
	outputDebugString("players playerName1 and playerName2 do NOT share the same name. playerName1: " .. tostring(playerName1) .. ", playerName2: " .. tostring(playerName2))  -- &lt; this is a debug line
end


	 
 


	Debug console
 


"players playerName1 and playerName2 do NOT share the same name. playerName1: snake1, playerName2: cow"


	
		 
	 

	


	 
 


	Easy isn't? 
 


	The concept behind this debug method is to see what the code does / doesn't execute.
 


	 
 


	Is this method handy?
 


	It is actually the very basic of debugging, for code that doesn't contain any errors/warnings. I would say it is handy and it is a very powerful method too.
 


	 
 


	It is also handy for people who do not know how to script.
 


	If you want people to help you with your code, but you do not know what is wrong with it. You can add those debug lines and point out to where the code stops working. This will make it more efficient for you and the scripter to work out the problem, because the scripter knows where to look.
 


	 
 


	How much debug lines do you have to add to your script? 1? 10? 100? 1000?
 


	You could start with around 100 debug lines and as you learn how to script, you can reduce it to 10+ debug lines. Too much debug lines are not always good, because they will give you too much information and it will cost time to manually filter them. So I recommend you to remove some of them afterwards. When you are finished with the tested code, you can remove 90+% of them. Feel free to disable them instead of removing them, if you know that you are going to need them again.
 


	 
 


	For complex code, I use around 25 debug lines, SO DON'T HOLD BACK!
 


	
		 
	 

	
		Render events
	 

	
		It is strongly recommended to remove debug lines that are executed on onClientRender/render events when you are finished with your code. Because that can have influence on the smooth fps.(It will not drop much of the fps, but it can make it feel unsmooth)
	 

	
		 
	 

	


	 
 


	Clearing the debug console?
 


/cleardebug


	 
 


	
		 
	 

	


	 
 


	Know your tools:
 


outputDebugString -- Show a message on the Debug Console
bool outputDebugString ( string text, [ int level=3, int red=255, int green=255, int blue=255 ] )   

---

outputConsole -- Show a message on the F8 panel.
bool outputConsole ( string text ) -- client
bool outputConsole ( string text, [ element visibleTo=getRootElement() ] ) -- server

---

inspect -- Convert one mixed value to a string.
string inspect ( mixed var )   

---

print -- Show a message on the terminal / serverwindow / Debug Console.
bool print ( string var1[, string var2, string var3...] )  

---

tostring() -- Convert a value in to a string. (but for objects/elements, inspect works better)

---

iprint -- Show a message on the terminal / serverwindow / Debug Console (convert multiple mixed values automatic to string, no need for tostring or inspect)
bool iprint ( mixed var1[, mixed var2, mixed var3...] )    

---

outputChatBox -- You can also debug with outputChatBox (even though it is less efficient)
bool outputChatBox ( string text [, int r=231, int g=217, int b=176, bool colorCoded=false ] ) -- client
bool outputChatBox ( string text [, element visibleTo=getRootElement(), int r=231, int g=217, int b=176, bool colorCoded=false ] ) -- server


	
		Debug message levels
	 

	
			0: Custom message
		
		
			1: Error message
		
		
			2: Warning message
		
		
			3: Information message (default)

	Advanced tools:
 


local line = debug.getinfo(1).currentline -- get the line of the script where the code has been executed.


	1 = current function. (can be useful if you want to get the line where this function has been called from)

			Section Rules
 


	1. Any fulfilled requests or discarded offers shall be reported via the report system in order to be locked and/or archived. 
	This is mandatory, as the goal is to keep this section as clean and accurate as possible. 
	 
 


	2.Topics must have a sufficient description of what are you offering or looking for. 
	Eg. if you're looking for a scripter for your gamemode, you must detail what would you need the scripter for. This doesn't exactly involve giving away the whole concepts or whatever you don't want to disclose to the public, but it would be appreciated if you could include more details than just straight single line offers, such as "I need a scripter for a zombie gamemode".
 


	Whether or not the amount of detail is sufficient for the nature of your request is a subject to moderator judgement, and failing to meet criteria may result in your post being discarded.
 


	 
 


	Formatting your topic
 


	In order to keep the section clean, accurate and easily viewable, it would be appreciated if you could use the following guidelines for your topic:
 


	1. Topic titles should have the form [LF/OFFERING] Brief description [Paid/Non-Paid]. Please make the description as brief as possible here. Eg:
 


	
		[OFFERING] Skilled scripter [Paid]
	
	
		[OFFERING] Rookie modeller looking for some practice [Non-paid]
	
	
		[LF] Any-level scripter for a small server [Non-Paid]
	



	 
 


	2. The first post should be written in at least 2 parts:
 


	
		first part should contain a brief description of yourself (and/or the server or community you are from)
	
	
		second part should elaborate on what are you requesting/offering, once again, as detailed as you possibly can/want
