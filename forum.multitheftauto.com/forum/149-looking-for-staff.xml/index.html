	Explanations :<br />
	<u>(QUALITY)</u><br />
	   Sometimes when the job's detail miss something that players would love to have, it would be nice if you realize and just do the code without us asking. <br />
	Because the guy who writes your job's detail is not an I.T. guy (me).<br />
	Sometimes I'm not aware, especially the small things.<br />
	<strong>But hey, small things are mostly the details that players would love to have. <br />

<p>
	<u><strong>Summary:</strong></u><br />
	Hello. We, as part of 6MonthzIn are working on creating a zombie apocalypse roleplay server. The current state of the game world is 2 years into the outbreak of the virus, 6 months after the collapse of the US government. As such, vegetation has yet taken over the urban environment. The streets are riddled with chaos but the infrastructure, except for minimal damage, is still in tact.
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>Work:</strong></u><br />
	We don't want to just litter the streets with random chaos but more aim towards having our mapping tell small stories of what has happened in said location. We use an object pack for some extra details which you, of course, can use. We ask mappers to keep the object amount to a minimal. See below screenshots of mapping that is already done to give you an idea of what we are aiming towards.

</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>OVERVIEW: </strong></u>
</p>

<p>
	Our team comes from a huge and well established Roleplay Community from San Andreas Multiplayer, which has been languishing in the past months/years and is on its way to end soon. As Roleplay lovers and with a vast community of fans, we decided to invest in a platform more prone to putting our dreams and plans into operation, something that was impossible to do in the previous one due to several limitations and because it stopped developing years ago. We started the development of a Game Mode from scratch months ago with our team of developers, mappers, modelers and engineers. In a new universe, we will put the impossible and the never idealized into practice, ideas never thought before to enrich Roleplay. 
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>POSITION SUMMARY:</strong></u>
</p>

<p>
	We are looking for people with or without experience as developers in Multi Theft Auto, so prior knowledge or willingness to learn LUA is more than necessary. Internship opportunities for those interested in learning or starting as a programmer are also offered by us. As mentioned before, we have a large and united team working on the project for months, so, like any serious company, we are looking for people willing to work as a team, respecting the harmonious environment we live in, in addition to contributing to further unity.
</p>

	• Portuguese<br />
	• French<br />
	• Spanish <br />
	 
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>SKILLS &amp; EXPERIENCE:</strong></u>
</p>

<p>
	• Knowledge in programming logic<br />
	• Knowledge/interest to learn software engineering<br />
	• Knowledge/interest to learn software design patterns<br />
	• Familiarity with Roleplay servers<br />
	• Knowledge/interest to learn SQL structure<br />
	• Must produce clean and easy to understand code that follows our convention<br />
	• Excellent verbal and written communication skills<br />
	• Ability to effectively present information to management and/or public groups<br />
	• Optional: Experience with any modern JS frameworks (Angular, React, Vue)<br />
	• Optional: Experience with any modern PHP frameworks 
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>RESPONSABILITIES:</strong></u>
</p>

<p>
	• Be able to receive mentorship from senior developers on best practices, design patterns, etc<br />
	• Collaborate with management and others engineers to get the job done efficiently<br />
	• Participate in the full development lifecycle<br />
	• Be able to listen and contribute to a harmonic environment<br />
	• Prepares reference/comments in code for future developers<br />
	• Contributes to team effort by accomplishing related results as needed<br />
	• Supports system upgrades as necessary
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:</strong></u>
</p>

<p>
	Reiterating the summary of the positions we offer, we offer the opportunity for beginners, or even those who want to learn to program, the opportunity to learn with us and, consequently, contribute to the project. Don't be shy about it, the will to learn is what is necessary to achieve our goals and objectives.

<p style="background-color:#343a40;color:#fafafa;font-size:14px;">
	I'm trying to find a person who will translate a few thousand lines of text from English to Turkish. I like Turkish people and I would love to give them an opportunity to enjoy my server in their native language.
</p>

<p style="background-color:#343a40;color:#fafafa;font-size:14px;">
	I have a long translation file with a bunch of text and I basically need the person to add new lines for tr and translate them.
</p>

<p style="background-color:#343a40;color:#fafafa;font-size:14px;">
	 
</p>

<p style="background-color:#343a40;color:#fafafa;font-size:14px;">

	["lobbyName"] = {<br />
	        en="Welcome",<br />
	        pt="Bem-vindo",<br />
	        es="Bienvenido",<br />
	        ru="Добро пожаловать",<br />

</p>

<p style="background-color:#343a40;color:#fafafa;font-size:14px;">
	I can pay you 10 € on Skrill or Paypal if you do a good job and translate my entire translation file, which should take you something like 8 hours.

<p>
	Even though the overall framework has been finished for several years, there are lots of necessary improvements in order to enhancing game's content.
</p>

<p>
	As you know, it's difficult to make a good server having huge systems by myself, I really hope some developers are willing to achieve this purpose, to build a dream exactly. 
</p>

<p>
	It's better that you have a good experience on <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">mta</abbr> development because I hope all your works being able to catch high quality.

<p>
	<u><strong>OVERVIEW:</strong></u>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Our team comes from a huge and well established Roleplay Community from San Andreas Multiplayer, which has been languishing in the past months/years and is on its way to end soon. As Roleplay lovers and with a vast community of fans, we decided to invest in a platform more prone to putting our dreams and plans into operation, something that was impossible to do in the previous one due to several limitations and because it stopped developing years ago. We started the development of a Game Mode from scratch months ago with our team of developers, mappers, modelers and engineers. In a new universe, we will put the impossible and the never idealized into practice, ideas never thought before to enrich Roleplay. In the spoiler below I will attach some pictures of a map we did as an example of what we do to enrich our Roleplay environment and innovate:</span>

	Project Genesis
</p>

<p>
	Q: What is Project Genesis?<br />
	A: Project Genesis is a Multi Theft Auto server with RPG gamemode based on Grand Theft Auto V Online
</p>

<p>
	We are trying to recreate the things you do in <abbr title="Grand Theft Auto">GTA</abbr> V online in <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr>:SA, I want to let you now that the server is in heavy development because it was started only 2 weeks ago. But I wanted to announce the server early so that players can enter the server faster and see our progress made with the server.<br />
	We are also looking for staff members, testers and people to promote the server. You can do this on our forum: <a href="https://projectgenesismta.boards.net/" rel="external nofollow">https://projectgenesismta.boards.net/</a> (We are using a free forum for now until we see how the server status will be when it will be ready).
</p>

<p>
	Before making a request for tester, staff or social management(for the people who want only to promote the server on other <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">mta</abbr> platforms that has a self-promote channel), please read the models on this link: <a href="https://projectgenesismta.boards.net/board/11/recruitment-template" rel="external nofollow">https://projectgenesismta.boards.net/board/11/recruitment-template</a>

	STAFF Recruitment: <a href="https://projectgenesismta.boards.net/board/12/staff-recruitment" rel="external nofollow">https://projectgenesismta.boards.net/board/12/staff-recruitment</a><br />
	Tester Recruitment: <a href="https://projectgenesismta.boards.net/board/13/tester-recruitment" rel="external nofollow">https://projectgenesismta.boards.net/board/13/tester-recruitment</a><br />
