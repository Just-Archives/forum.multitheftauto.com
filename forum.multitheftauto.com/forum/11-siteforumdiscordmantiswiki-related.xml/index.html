	As the title mentions, basically my idea is to have a channel on discord that frequently announces the progress of each language available on Crowdin. This channel should be <em>read only</em> as it will be an informative channel.
</p>

<p>
	People that are interested in seeing this channel should react in #extra-roles to get a role. In this channel will be announced the percentage of each language, highlighting mainly those languages that need more people (less than 50% translated, for example).<br />
	To prevent the same message being sent too many times, it could be configured to announce the progress once every 15 days or something.
</p>

<p>
	I suppose this serves both as a way to attract new translators, and also for those who would like to review/fix existing translations.

	There's no much to say about this suggestion but <a href="https://multitheftauto.crowdin.com/multitheftauto" rel="external nofollow">Crowdin/translations</a> are barely announced although it's really helpful to Community. So i was wondering if we could have at least a link at the top and an icon on the bottom of the forum that forward people to to the plataform.

	I think the <a href="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/forum/180-ban-appeals/" rel="">Ban Appeals</a> section should be excluded from the forum's default activity stream (recent posts) for the following reasons:
</p>

<p>
	- Global <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr> ban appeals are only intended to be handled by <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr> staff. Regular users shouldn't comment on them.
</p>

<p>
	- New ban appeals are posted almost every day, several times a day and seem to be happening more and more frequently.
</p>

<p>
	- A lot of appeal attempts are invalid and end up getting a reply by a moderator &amp; locked quickly.
</p>

<p>
	- Many of the posts are in another language, and generally not interesting for anyone who is not staff to read through.
</p>

<p>
	- Hiding Ban Appeal posts from the recent posts stream will give more exposure to other interesting posts like Resource showcases or Looking for help posts.
</p>

<p>
	- Forum feed will feel less spammed.
</p>

	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	Today, we will talk about the Toplist service provided by <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
	Toplist service is now considered as a player collection service in <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr> Turkey because those who receive Toplist service see the player they have not seen.
</p>

<p>
	In the past, everyone worked hard and got rewarded. Now you buy the Toplist service and you see 100 players, it's bull:~.
</p>

<p>
	I tried to mention this situation to the <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr> managers, but most of them did not even respond.
</p>

<p>
	Don't you think this is ridiculous? Servers that have been working for years / servers with high players are at the bottom of the list. This should now be regulated.
</p>

<p>
	Sample;<br />
	Today I saw that a few servers receive 2 Toplist services and redirect to their servers.
</p>

<p>
	At the very least, this may only apply to main servers. It should not be allowed to receive more than one Toplist service and redirect to the servers.
</p>

	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	I'm not sure if it's possible to do this but it would be interesting to redirect our users to to their translated main page (when clicking in <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr> Wiki logo) - if his language has any, since there are many translated versions, which would helpful to those who would like to start learning but can't it due to the language barrier.<br />
	Basically, instead of using the sidebar everytime to pick your language, you could be redirected automatically depending on your country (through IP?) or when changing the language in Preferences page.

	Dear MTA forums administration,
</p>

<p>
	there appears to be a fair amount of users on our forums that auto-translate all of the content on this web-page. Support topics start with the impression that they are awkwardly-speaking-but-trying English speakers but in replies the quotes turn out to be Spanish, Polish, etc giving away that they actually auto-translate everything. There are people who do not know about this problem because they just set the auto-translator for everything English. Those people suffer from issues of understanding, essentially because the auto-translator botches-up the original writing.
</p>

<p>
	I suggest that users should have the ability to decide whether their forums posts should be posted using auto-translation disabled on the HTML elements. This can be done using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-translate-flag.en" rel="external nofollow">HTML translate attribute</a> on div tags. I suggest that there be a new option in the user's preferences to put this attribute on all of their posts by default. Then you should be able to decide on an individual post's basis if auto-translation should be allowed.
</p>

<p>
	Please think about the future of our forums. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f600.png" class="ipsEmoji" alt="😀">

	Dear MTA wiki support team,
</p>

<p>
	recently I have been trying to perform changes to the MTA wiki content but have been denied due to a strange error message. A different message is being shown when trying to log out and log in. By assessing the whole set of error messages I am assuming that the MTA wiki is hit by a web service outage and cannot be maintained. Please note that the error messages do wrongfully put the blame on the user or the hijacking of his data but I doubt it is true because I have also tried to login with invalid login data through a Tor node and the same errors happened.

	Hello MTA community,
</p>

<p>
	in support requests I am facing some difficulty understanding why the relationship between supporter and the to-be-supported is difficult. I am sensing that we are living in a <a href="https://osdn.net/projects/magic-txd/forums/33387/44813/" rel="external nofollow">world ruled by smartphones</a> and that many users browse using devices which do not come with a <strong>comfortable </strong><b>keyboard</b>. Understandably, I would not want to type long replies - including thoughtful elaborations and direct explicative answers to supporter questions - on a touchscreen keyboard.
</p>

<p>
	As a way to mend wounds by increased understanding I suggest detection of smartphone or PC presence on the forums. Since I am a developer I know that this is possible by voluntary browser meta-data provided by forum clients. Please give my suggestion an educated thought!
</p>

	Hi everyone, I recently re-joined MTA DM after many years of not playing. I am struggling to find any server with the old style gamemodes and maps. In particular, I am looking for Zombie Death Match gamemode where you spawn in some map and have to kill all humans if you are a zombie or survive as human if you are a human. Then the other gamemodes like climbing (bicycle and so on), hay climbing and others. Is there not a server with these gamemodes? If not I would be happy to make one if there was interest.
