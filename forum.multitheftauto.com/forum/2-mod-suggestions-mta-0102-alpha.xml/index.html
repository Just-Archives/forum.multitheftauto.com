<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stunt Time</span></strong></p>
<p>in thise gametype, you have to get as high a stunt score as possible, and unique stunts give you points instead of cash. person with the most points or first to reach the score limit wins!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">SPANK Hoard</span></strong></p>
<p>the aim of this team game is to have as many SPANK packages in your base marker at the end of the time limit.  SPANK packages are spread out across Liberty City, and driving through one will pick it up.  You can only carry 5 packages at a time, and you must get them back to your base which is a giant mission marker where they will be dropped in the marker randomly.  enemies can pick up packages from your base to take it back to theirs, so its both a game of searching, offense, AND defence all in one. you could also set it as an option to win if one team has every package in the level</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Cops &amp; Robbers</span></strong></p>
<p>this game has 1 randomly selected person as the bad guy, and everyone else are cops.  The cops try to kill the robber, and when the robber is killed, the person who killed him becomes the robber.  you need to stay alive the longest time as the rober to win</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Full Wing Dodo Disaster</span></strong></p>
<p>There are tons of Full Wing Dodo's flying about. When one is destroyed, it drops a package that you mush collect.  The person with the most packages wins.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tank Battle</span></strong></p>
<p>Each player starts in a tank in a random part of the city.  The tanks are modified to have the explosions be like petrol bomb explosions (which enough of can destroy tanks). Simply kill as many other tanks as possible (you cant get out of your tank)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">RC Bandit Deathmatch</span></strong></p>
<p>Everyone is controlling RC Cars and are trying to destroy other player RC Cars with a flamethrower attached to the front of he car (getting hit by flame instantly kills them)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Tanks &amp; Whoopies</span></strong></p>
<p>same as the cops &amp; robbers, but cops are replaced by tanks, robbers replaced by whoopies</p>

<p>The (invincible) Mr. Whoopie would be a yellow blip on the radar, and when you get in, you have to stay in the whoopie as long as possible.  Being bumped by another car would throw the player out of the whoopie.  The aim is to have the longest time in the whoopie, or hold the whoopie for a set amount of time</p>

<p>With all the modes for MTA </p>
<p>-Deathmatch </p>
<p>-Team Deathmatch </p>
<p>-Liberty City Survivor (last man standing) </p>
<p>-Freeze Tag (name could be changing) </p>
<p>-Speed</p>
<p>-more?</p>
<p>I'm wondering how the mode selection is handled?</p>
<p>I'm guessing it is currently selected when the server is started.</p>
<p>Keeping with this spirit of GTA, would it be possible to have players trigger game modes like missions?</p>
<p>e.g. walk into the bus/ice cream truck/taxi and hit "+"  ... or trigger a rampage for survivor</p>
<p>This wouldn't make sense for team games, but some sort of dm_multi_modes would be awsome.</p>

<p>This way, we can all enjoy the fun of multiplayer, Vice City, Liberty City and also motorcycles and helicopters!!!</p>
<p>Just a suggestion, tell me what you think!!</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I'm not saying to combine them, I already know about GTA World, what I'm trying to say is instead of Vice in Liberty, put Liberty in Vice, that way we can have heli's and bike's!!!</p>

Small Gangs.</title><link>https://forum.multitheftauto.com/topic/736-big-world-small-gangs/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>This is basically something thing similar to gangs, however, mta would have to be able to handle hundreds on ppl per ALL OF liberty city.. however lag could be reduced by only showing ppl in the "donut" or "bubble" or "ring". anways you basically start out as a citizen.. just walking around.. there wil be other gangs and citz like you.. you can either walk up to a gang and try to be initiated.. or start you own simply be making a skins for your self (note: when you connect, you are sent all the gangs skins) you can try to asualt another gang.. or do whatever you want.. basicaly a huge server is left on 24-7 and you just connect to the world and try to create something for your self.. if you are wearing a skin anyother than default, you are considers to be part of a gang, and ranked two ways: by your percentages of members with the same skin or the land area you take up.. like for every 10sft there are 60% of xyz gang. you can make up rules.. choose how to initiate people.. etc.. you dont have to have wars.. and you goal is to try to get ppl from all over earth, so if you sleep, you gang will still exist.. (timezones) i know that there have been other ideas similar to this: gangwars, king of the hill, turf wars.. etc.. i just combined them and made it soud sweet to me.. anybody like it?</p>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">736</guid><pubDate>Wed, 14 May 2003 03:10:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Gametype IDEA!!!!!</title><link>https://forum.multitheftauto.com/topic/101-gametype-idea/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Dont know if this will work but it sounded good when i thought of it  <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":D" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png"></p>
<p>this is how it will work:</p>
<p>Everyone will spawn in a random spot (just like deathmatch) and they will be given a certain person to kill and it will display them on the radar as a dot, if they kill the person they have been told to kill they will get a point, and if the person you were trying to kill kills you they will get a point, but....... if you kill someone that you were not told to kill or was not trying to kill you you will lose a point. if you die you will just respawn and get another target to kill, if you kill your target you will just get another one to kill.  the person that is trying to kill you will not be displayed on the radar.</p>
<p>this type will not work until you get a scoring system happining.</p>
<p>Please post your thoughts/ideas and say if you think it will be fun or not in the poll thing.</p>

<p>Do you remember Assault in UT? Team A must assault the base of team B in a timelimit. When it's done, Team A must defend the base as long as the first limit was.</p>
<p>I think it's a great idea for GTA3 in multiplayer  <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":)" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/smile.png"></p>
<p>I give just an example:</p>
<p>Base:</p>
<p>The skysraper, wich you can go upstairs (uh, english?  <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":shock:" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/icon_eek.gif.897dbbed7132c9b31d6323894b60db2d.gif"> )</p>
<p>Its the 11 in this map:</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="2.jpg" data-src="http://members.lycos.co.uk/dasboese/GTA3/2.jpg"></p>
<p>Here's a cutout of the 'base':</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="1.jpg" data-src="http://members.lycos.co.uk/dasboese/GTA3/1.jpg"></p>
<p>I think thats a good place for that. If team A wants to take the base, they must take 2-3 checkpoins (for example a cycle where a member of the team must get in to get the checkpoint), wich can't be taken anymore by team B.</p>
<p>A team has &gt;=5 members</p>
<p>And weapons... Mhh... I don't know exactly now...  <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":?" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/icon_confused.gif.faeb66555d688bc415e5579d12af639a.gif"></p>
<p>As base you can take the airport or a subway station or something else too.</p>
<p>What do you think about that?  <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":)" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

That way if a friend wanted to take a break. You could carry his ass around town with you, but the button should only be available for you to join other players cars. (AI drivers are all granny drivers) and if you really want to get into it, two more people should be able to hop in the back! That would make dieing that much more fun... Maybe you should only implement this in Vice City so that a user doesn't have to feel like ur cab driver buddy is gonna drive him to some deserted location and anal rape you. Cause' obviously in Vice City you can make a quick escape, lol. </p>
<p>Think about it, and. Have you guys ever used one idea from a fan?</p>

<p>so, at beggining of the game there is one player called "the one". he can stop time whenever he wants, he can do dodging (get away from bullets like in matrix) till rocket doesn't explode next to his legs, slow down the time and mabey jum at the same time to the side lke in max payne and he can evade bullets and rockets back to one who is shooting when the time is stopped. but, there is bullet time limit which goes up when "the one" kills other player. when limit goes down to zero he can't do any of the things. player who kills "the one" is the "one"</p>
<p>PS i will make the poll to see if people like this.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to play GTA MTA because the netcode doesn't seem to work via a (non-uPnP) router. Maybe you should include a small block of text in the program saying wich ports should be redirected in order for MTA to work via a router.</p>
<p>I saw in the movies though, that it seems that only the position of the other car(s) is transferred; not the speed. If you transfer the speed (and direction e.d.) as well, the client can calculate the next position of the car without having to receive another packet. This results in much smoother motion (especially with low-bandwidth connections), and you only have to send another packet if something unpredictable happens (i.e. the steering wheel is turned or something). You could let the client calculate the next position, then check on the real position, and if it differs to much, adjust the motion variables and send a packet to the server.</p>
<p>The other idea i had was about gameplay.</p>
<p>You could make a small modification to the map so that you have a small building somewhere wich you can enter, and if you enter it, you can switch between single- &amp; multiplayer. If you enter the building, it's to difficult to print all the server-related crap on a texture or something, so i think you could best let an always-on-top window overlap gta 3. Somehow you need to lock the character then, because you don't want it to walk &amp; shoot while you type in new server adresses.</p>
<p>Ofcourse the building has to be locked when you're busy doing a singleplayer mission, and the entrance of it should be only accessable on foot; you don't want someone in MTA to block the entrance with a tank <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=";)" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/wink.png"></p>
<p>It should be close to the spawnpoint(s) as well, so you can switch when you're in a heavy gangwar to.</p>
<p>Maybe you can just use existing buildings, put a door in it, and a banner-texture that says something like "MTA SwitchHouse" <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":P" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png"></p>
<p>Well, that's about all i could think of, keep up the good work guys!</p>
<p>=edit=</p>
<p>If you implement the building, you could rename the original gta3.exe to gta3-original.exe or something, and replace the gta3.exe which then initializes and calls gta3-original.exe. Then you can just play GTA3 like MTA wasn't there, and the only difference will be the special building. That way you don't have to have a configurationscreen when starting GTA; it will only popup when you enter the building.</p>

<p>First off I saw that TurfWars were already in the posts so read that post or get it completely here</p>
<p>the 3 Cities are on different servers each (not just 3 servers but EVERY server has only ONE city) (for the dumbasses this means : Staunton, Portland and Shoreside not Liberty city as a whole)</p>
<p>STARTERS: </p>
<p>Choose Cops On/OFF</p>
<p>The different Gangs represented in the city are chosen</p>
<p>Weapons allowed in game are chosen.</p>
<p>Lives: unlimited/10 lives etc etc.</p>
<p>JOINERS</p>
<p>First of Players choose a city, this opens a page where he/she can choose from different servers supporting that city</p>
<p>Once you've chosen a server you can Choose which Gang you want to Join (availability is shown every gang has a max of 8 Joiners)</p>
<p>then you get to choose from certain skins for the respective gang.</p>
<p>Instead of choosing a gang you can also choose freelance. which only has 4 joiners</p>
<p>once this is done you spawn at the Base of your Gang (this is the standard spawning point for your character throughout the game.)</p>
<p>The Headquarters of your gang is basically a huge building with a penthouse Downstairs you have different vehicles.</p>
<p>example: a limo, 2 cars and an SUV. the cars respawn like in GTA3, or when destroyed. you decide</p>
<p>a level higher (where you spawn!) you have your gangs weapons depot. only the Pistol is free (your no good to the gang without firepower) but the other weapons are available at a reduced cost ( Freelancers have still have to buy it full price!) the top level is just for sniping during defense of your Headquarters from enemy assaults.</p>
<p>Now what is exactly the point of the game?</p>
<p>A Turf war! pressing a hotkey will show a map consisting of different colors (one for each Gang... freelancers don't have a turf) The City has several objects (flags alla battlefield) to capture in order to add the territory to your gangs turf. </p>
<p>Now the Gang it self is headed by an A.I. Boss and his 2.... 3 luitenants, As long as the boss is alive you can do jobs in order to Purchase weapons and do whatever you need money to do. (bombs etc.)  the boss will stay most of the game in the penthouse guarded by 4 or more heavily armed guards. however occasionally the A.I. Triggers a boss to go to some place. (He wants to have a social life too ya know), this immediately sends a message to all players showing Which boss and where he's going ( club, beach whatever!) this is a perfect chance for enemies to take out the boss using an ambush (either at where he is, where he's going, when he's going back) of course he and his body guards aint stupid and are programmed to head for the penthouse ASAP when trouble brews.</p>
<p>Note: not all weapons such as sniper rifle/ RPG should be available! or if they are ... they shouldn't be easily obtained and shouldn't contain too much ammo! 5 max!!!</p>
<p>If in the sad event your Boss dies your Gang can nolonger take on jobs for 5-10 minutes during this time one of the luitentants will prepare himself to take the control of the family.</p>
<p>when all original luitenants have been liquidated your gang is disbanded and you Lose! once this happens you'll loose Honor/respect points and the 4 with the lowest Honor points are booted from the server, the remaining 4 become freelancers(probably out to avenge their Families death or something)</p>
<p>The Game ends when only ONE family still remains.</p>
<p>So what are the freelancers doing there? they're just basically there for fun Deathmatching and try to gain honor points and fatten their swiss bank accounts.</p>
<p>See you make an account in order to play the game. you start off with $0.00 and no honor and work yourself up. getting respect for the amount of money/honor you have.</p>
<p>Of course Death has a High toll on your Bank account (5-10%) not to mention the Weapons/armor/bombs</p>
<p>Killing your gang members deducts honor ( being the driver and getting the car blown up, sunk, or just shooting them) Honor is simply what people will look at to know if they can trust you enough when it really matters (not that he blows YOUR head off when your in a heated fire fight) Honor is displayed next to the total matches that character has played, example ( H:4 P: 4) you'd know that this guy only played 4 matches in total and has a pretty high honor (if highest is 100) for a rook. but if you see (H:4 P:34) you know he's a double crossing bastard and you try to stay as far away from him as you can. ( he might be sadistical and rig a bomb on one of your cars and park in in your HQ's garage he looses honor but gains cash for blowing up the car)</p>
<p>Honor is displayed in a ball hovering above all characters that are Non A.I. allies (like the arrow above Targets in Gta only alot smaller)</p>
<p>Honor points are also gained by accomplishing missions, killing Human players, killing Gang bosses, Defeating a Gang, winning the Game and maybe more you can think of.</p>
<p>MORE DETAILS ON TURF WARS</p>
<p>A.I. Gang members are spawned in the territories you control. they'll patrol in cars and on foot. even when the turf is retaken they'll keep on patrolling till they're dead.</p>
<p>owning territories outside your initial turf causes money to flow in to all players on your gang the more turf the more money.</p>
<p>Cities are divided into 3 or 4 sections these are in turn divided into territories.</p>
<p>Cities contain 2 or 3 Gangs, every server might have different gangs in the same city.</p>
<p>These Gangs start in a section of the city controlling the territories aroun their HQ</p>
<p>JOBS.</p>
<p>For Freelancers there are Payphones in every section of the City where they can pick up jobs: Jobs probably have to do with harrassing the local Gangs. Killing their members/bosses planting bombs or small/simple missions similar to those in the single playergame the Missions will sometimes repeat themselves but with new areas/targets.</p>
<p>For the Gangmembers the phones are in the HQ and in Territories under your control. Mostly these phones will hint you on what to do (find a sniper rifle here, rigg a car with a bomb etc.</p>
<p>When you get a job, like dropping something off at Luigi's or something an enemy player might get a beeped message from his boss to intercept you, and he might bring back-up!</p>
<p>END</p>
<p>It'd be cool Hopping into cars with 3 of your friends packed with uzi's and Rush to the the enemy base for a drive by shooting perhaps followed by another car filled with mates.</p>
<p>or block off a road to the club and wait with a AK-47 in your hand together with your "brothers" on the enemy boss who'll be arriving shortly. see the whole point of this type of game is that you operate in groups.</p>
<p>And you have responsibilities, you have to make sure your GANG stays alive so protect your bosses. (maybe the limo has been rigged better get in there and blow yourself up in order to save the boss) You have to help your Partners take down the enemies.</p>
<p>EL ALAMEIN</p>
<p>Each team gets 4 tanks and hold a tank battle in some isolated area with large open areas and a few buildings.</p>
<p>If all of one teams tanks are destroyed they loose, RPG's available too!</p>
<p>spawns indefinite but with a wait out time (20 seconds or so)</p>
<p>THE GAME (as in the movie with Ice T)</p>
<p>there's a time limit and one guy gets chased DM style by several others until it runs out (5 - 10 minutes or something) nice cat and mouse game</p>

<p>Maybe players can promise a reward for killing someone they don't like.</p>
<p>This feature could make the game less attractive though, when not worked out properly. (for instance:You could become hunted by everyone)</p>

Like just a mod of the map and a road leading to a massice carpark?</p>
<p>Would that be extremely hard?  Maybe in VC we could have out own apartments? But that will happen in a long time.</p>

<p>How Bout A GANG WAr D- DAy Style???? Let me Explain</p>
<p>U have One Gang Pull Up IN Boats ON The Shore And TRy to overtake the island, and they have dodos with bombs to take out enemy posistions</p>
<p>The Other Gang Has Tanks and hummers, And Dodos with a machine guns to try and shoot down enemy bombers</p>
<p>The team thats trying to overtake the island has a time limit to do so or they lose</p>
<p>Each soldier is outifitted with a specialty: (SNipers, Pilots, rockets, explosives, heavy gunners, light gunners, etc)</p>
<p>For fun medics could be pimps and prostitutes.... </p>
<p>I know u guys are smarter then me so u probably could make this idea a lot better.... so lets make it work</p>

Connect to a server, a list of whats about to be changed comes up, user accepts or disconnects.  Upon exit, everything is restored.</p>
<p>GTA multiplayer rocks.  Customizability is even better.</p>
<p>If you want to send me just the functions for initial server connection, I can code the rest myself.</p>

<p>-have MTA wait for a hotkey like TAB.</p>
<p>-when a player hits it, you see the car jack animation, entering passenger's side.</p>
<p>-if the passenger seat is taken (MTA Server will remember) then it shows the animation of one of lugi's grils getting in a back seat, then you had to do the "Fuzz Ball" mission. (cept with your model)</p>
<p>-once in the car, it maskes (removes) your controls (the same way they will be removed in chat)</p>
<p>-it tells <em>your copy of gta3</em> that you are driving the car...</p>
<p>-but since you dont have controls... there is not effect... and this allows the camera to follow the car, because your gta3 thinks your driving.</p>
<p>-the server know what type of car you have.. so it know the maximum people per car..</p>
<p>-press TAB and in shows the animation of the girls exiting, cept with your model. </p>
<p>-this allowes you to enter a car.. and not jack it. enter key would do the same, but jack the car so everyone would be kicked out.</p>
<p>NOTES:</p>
<p>-if you want to have 360° shooting:</p>
<p>--instead of telling gta3 your driving the car.. when you presst SHIFT+TAB, in just align you coodinates with the cars.</p>
<p>--it uses a little offset so your head is under the roof.</p>
<p>--for as long as your in the car.. determined localy by your MTA (no need to sync.. since its changng your coord's everyone else will see that neway.) you will be able to rotate as usual, just not walk, because your coord's are synced.</p>
<p>--when you press SHIFT+TAB, it stops syncing them.</p>
<p>BTW: i know there are other threads about multi people in a car. but i decided that my idea was new, and i didnt want to reply to a thread weeks old. so i made a fresh thread for a fresh thought.</p>
<p>NOTE: my second idea for 360° is not foolproof. i have not thought it out completely. but can anyone find a problem with the frist?</p>

<p>how about a list? (kinda like html thing)</p>
<p>just double click it and it's added to the "join game" field?</p>
<p>now it just looks...messy kinda..</p>
<p>also, there is no reason for the user to see the irc window, i doubt *any* normal user will have any use for it.</p>
<p>and the "Support/Readme" should simply be a popup window that comes if you click a 'help button' or something..</p>
<p>in the end, the gui might actually look nice.. <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":)" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/smile.png"></p>
