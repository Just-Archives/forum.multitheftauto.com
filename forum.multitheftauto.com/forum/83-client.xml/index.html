	Hello.
</p>

<p>
	Duplicate serial number for several players.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is this: we ran into a problem that: In the process of how the global ban ac4 arrived, I began to figure out what the problem was.<br />
	Then it turned out that I have a non-unique serial number, then I found 2 more players with the same number and with the same problem
</p>

<p>
	We created a topic in the appeal, but it did not work. I would like to receive your detailed advice on this issue.
</p>

<p>
	Earlier in the topic, we said that it is necessary to write to the developers of our project, I did it and they said that this can only be changed by changing the serial number.
</p>

<p>
	<u>There are 2 options</u>: 1. spoffer, for which you will punish us 2. or buy a new ssd.
</p>

<p>
	But I didn't break any rules to spend money on a new ssd. Is there really any solution?<br />
	I spent 4 years playing this project and I don't want to leave it. Please help us resolve this.<br />
	I can attach the correspondence with the technical support of our project, if necessary, but it is in Russian.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	We also checked our ssds after aida64 and they have different numbers, this clearly says that it means it’s not the computer, but maybe somewhere there is a failure in the <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto"><abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">mta</abbr></abbr> itself and it distributed the same serial number to everyone.
</p>

<p>
	I will leave screenshots where there is data from aida, but it is interesting that we have three ADATA ssd manufacturers
</p>

</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	We were told that the <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto"><abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr></abbr> generates a serial number based on many factors, but we have different computers and components. And the serial number is the same throughout the <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto"><abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr></abbr> all over the world, which means that here it was the bug that occurred at the level of the <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto"><abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr></abbr> and the issuance of the serial number. Well, then someone already got a ban and he spread to everyone.
</p>

<p>
	The support of our project says that the problem is in the <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto"><abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr></abbr>, tell me, can you give us unique numbers for everyone so that this problem does not happen again?
</p>

	Hello. My problem is that when I set the 4: 3 chapter, the crosshair is flattened and crooked (the option to fit hud to screen does not work). on smaller resolutions it is only worse and the crosshair is straight only at 16: 9. I did reinstall the <abbr title="Grand Theft Auto">gta</abbr> and <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">mta</abbr> but it did not help

	We have an announcement to make regarding certain services and technologies, like "Cloud Gaming" platforms and various cloud / cloud VM and hypervisor based services and software.
</p>

<p>
	<br />
	Unfortunately, the majority of such services can no longer be used with MTA starting today. After observing a growing trend of abuse, such as server ban evading (serials related) we have enabled the same type of security, known as MTA serial verification - which usually applies to the most common consumer VM software - to all VM types and cloud services that we know of.
</p>

<p>
	This means that the procedure from <a href="https://updatesa.multitheftauto.com/sa/trouble/?tr=serial-validation" rel="external nofollow">https://updatesa.multitheftauto.com/sa/trouble/?tr=serial-validation</a> must be followed on all relevant services, not just the aforementioned.<br />
	Because most cloud &amp; VM hosting services won't provide users access to the host machine (that hosts the VM), we expect that most "cloud gaming" users will no longer be able to play MTA using said service. Not that MTA is an attractive game to play in cloud gaming though, we advise you to use MTA like a normal user (on your own PC) and understand that we care about servers being able to reliably ban players. Cloud gaming, for instance.. would constantly offer you a new so-called environment, allowing infinite serial swaps, making you hard to ban.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible for some people still being able to use relevant services, as these measures will only apply to newly generated MTA serials (not retroactively). This is intended.
</p>

<p>
	This topic is also relevant to the "<strong>There was a problem validating your serial</strong>" error and "Banned by MTA" with reason <strong>PROHIBITED VM TYPE / SECURITY VIOLATION</strong>
