	Good morning everyone!
</p>

<p>
	My name is Joshua, I am only the friend of the one of a server but together with him we are willing to do anything to improve our server as long as the price is reasonable. We are looking for a person who is capable of developing scripts, solving small bugs that exist. If possible we would like you to stay with us and take care of the scripts maintenance for at least 1 week after finishing your work, because if there are errors we would like to have the help of the same person who configured everything.
</p>

<p>
	If you have experience please do not hesitate to contact me and we will reach an agreement.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	PD. If you know Spanish that would be great.

While a lot of changes has been made to improve stability and add features, it is very important to note that this is still a nightly build, and not a full release version. It will contain bugs and issues, most of which are noted below alongside all known changes <strong>since the previous nightly</strong>. Many plans are still on the table, or are actively being worked on, so don't be discouraged.</p>
<blockquote data-ipsquote="" class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote-username="ixjf" data-cite="ixjf" data-ipsquote-contentapp="forums" data-ipsquote-contenttype="forums" data-ipsquote-contentid="79122" data-ipsquote-contentclass="forums_Topic"><div>Multi Theft Auto 0.6 Changelog:<p> CHANGES/FIXES - Client</p>
<p>    - All configuration files now use the XML file format.</p>
<p>    - Revamped GUI with an integrated server browser (not yet functional) - this allowed to fix a very large amount of issues, and greatly improved the maintainability of the code.</p>
<p>    - Fixed issue #50 (<a href="http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=50" rel="external nofollow">http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=50</a>) - Unable to launch GTA3</p>
<p>    - Fixed issue #39 (<a href="http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=39" rel="external nofollow">http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=39</a>) - Rewrite chat handling for server and client</p>
<p>    - Several data files were relocated due to coding changes</p>
<p>    - Program version number was updated from 0.5.1 to 0.6</p>
<p>    - Numerous other miscellaneous bug, memory leak, crash, and typographical fixes</p>
<p>CHANGES/FIXES - Server</p>
<p>    - Fixed issue #40 (<a href="http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=40" rel="external nofollow">http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=40</a>) - All configuration files now use the XML file format.</p>
<p>    - The server no longer announces to Game-Monitor.com. Instead, it uses a custom master server for MTA 0.5.1 (<a href="http://servers.projectredivivus.com" rel="external nofollow">http://servers.projectredivivus.com</a>) - this will change in upcoming builds.</p>
<p>    - Fixed issue #48 (<a href="http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=48" rel="external nofollow">http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=48</a>) - Lua functions don't check if the specified player/vehicle ID is valid</p>
<p>    - Fixed issue where Lua events wouldn't be triggered during script loading</p>
<p>    - Added Lua event onVehicleEnter for GTA3</p>
<p>    - Fixed kills not being processed by the server (and consequently score not working properly)</p>
<p>    - Disabled getPlayerDeaths (related to the issue fixed right above) - the behavior of this function was unclear</p>
<p>    - Fixed issue #47 (<a href="http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=47" rel="external nofollow">http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=47</a>) - Passing a nil value to Lua functions results in a server crash</p>
<p>    - Fixed issue #76 (<a href="http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=76" rel="external nofollow">http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=76</a>) - Data usage stats don't include Remote Admin connections</p>
<p>    - Fixed issue #26 (<a href="http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=26" rel="external nofollow">http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=26</a>) - Infinite money bug</p>
<p>    - Fixed issue #04 (<a href="http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=4" rel="external nofollow">http://bugs.projectredivivus.com/view.php?id=4</a>) - Add 'setPlayerPosition' Lua function</p>
<p>    - Since the chat code was rewritten, the Lua function outputChatBox is not available. It'll be in future builds.</p>
<p>    - Program version number was updated from 0.5.1 to 0.6</p>
<p>    - Numerous other miscellaneous bug, memory leak, crash, and typographical fixes</p>
<p>KNOWN ISSUES - Server</p>
<p>    - The server only shuts down after you close the process. If you type 'q' or 'quit' in the console but don't close it, as attempting to start another server on the same port will fail.</p>
<p>KNOWN ISSUES - Client</p>
<p>    - The in-game scoreboard sometimes takes a lot longer than it should to update.</p>
<p>    - The chat always appears on the loading screen.</p>
<p>    - The game crashes on the loading screen when using the VC 1.1 EXE.</p>
<p>    - The game often crashes when entering a vehicle (applies for both local and remote players).</p>
<p>    - The client randomly thinks the player died due to a punch/kick on game startup.</p>
<p>    - The client never times out, even if the connection to the server is lost</p>
<p>There are a lot of under-the-hood changes to the code which fixed many problems that existed before, and many that were introduced after the last nightly that had to be fixed.</p>

	It has been a long, rough ten years that Project Redivivus has been in existence, and no doubt it has not been easy for us at all. Still, through perseverance, our team has managed to continuously develop something special that has held so dear to everyone's hearts for a very long time. Despite financial and developmental hardships, and the constant gain and loss of those who we call part of our team, it has not stopped us from working toward a brighter future for these mods that we care so much about. We are here, we are still working hard, and we will continue to reach our goals to ensure that you have the opportunity to make more memories playing the game mods that you enjoy.<br><br><br>
	Now on the note of what I know everyone is dying to hear about: No, we are not done with 0.6 yet. I know this has been stalled for a very long time, and I wholeheartedly apologize. We have run into many issues throughout the years, which have only been made worse by heavy losses to our development team as people get older, get jobs, and move on with their lives. Despite this, we still have not given up, and we are closer to a release now than ever before. 0.6 Nightly 2 is on the verge of being made available, and this may very well be the final pre-development nightly before we move on to the next stage of stabilizing our development. The biggest thing holding us back right now are certain, specific key issues, bugs, and incomplete promised features that we feel are necessary for public use, as well as required to properly release a version that users can test for us. That being said, we are still constantly seeking out qualified, willing, trustworthy development team members that can help Project Redivivus breathe new life into our beloved Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City versions of Multi Theft Auto.

	Until the pinned topic can be updated to remove a few broken links and add additional ones, (some still work), here is another alternative download for MTA 0.5r2's files:<br><a href="http://files.projectredivivus.com/mta05r2/" rel="external nofollow">http://files.projectredivivus.com/mta05r2/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Please note: Your web browser and/or anti-virus program may falsely flag this website and the client installer, (as well as the client executable after installation), as malicious. <em><strong>These are known false positives.</strong></em> You can safely ignore the warnings. Several years ago, anti-virus programs began adding what are called heuristics to their applications in order to detect malicious software that definitions hadn't been created for yet. Unfortunately this also meant that both MTA 0.5 and MTA 0.5r2 were being falsely flagged as trojans or viruses when they contain absolutely no malicious code whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
	The reason behind them being falsely flagged is because years ago, the MTA Team protected the code from reverse engineering using a method called UPX packing. (This was to prevent people from pulling apart the code and creating hack programs or malicious servers). Common malware these days also uses this same method to conceal its code from security programs. Because UPX packing is most commonly used for bad programs more than good ones, many anti-virus companies have defaulted to just flagging anything and everything that is UPX packed as potentially malicious. Sadly this means that MTA 0.5 and MTA 0.5r2 are also wrongly flagged.
</p>

<p>
	I have attempted <em>numerous</em> times to contact Google and multiple anti-virus companies to have this false positive be added as an exception in their systems, however all of my efforts have fallen on deaf ears. Now for the good news: The upcoming version of Multi Theft Auto for GTA III and GTA:VC, MTA 0.6, will not have this problem. As MTA 0.6 is meant to be open-sourced upon release, such protection methods will be unnecessary and pointless, and thus will not be an issue that needs to be addressed.
</p>

<p>
	Many of you may ask, "Why not just release a version of 0.5/0.5r2 without the UPX packing?", and the answer is simple: We can't. The source we have for MTA 0.5, (which was also part of 0.5r2), is several months newer, as it contained several experimental fixes and changes that were not in the released version of 0.5. Several parts of the networking code and versioning internally are also different, so if we were to re-release 0.5/0.5r2 with these changes, it simply wouldn't work properly with existing clients. We <em>could</em> release a 0.5r3 with the UPX packing removed, the experimental code added, and the 0.5r2 and Server Patch 1 fixes included, however there is no telling what issues this may cause for users, and this would also open up a potential security hazard for those that still actively play 0.5r2, and are awaiting a 0.6 release. To us, this is not worth the risk involved.

	Built using a Windows 10 Insider Preview SDK, with an updated version of Boost, and a whole lot of wasted time.

	MTA vice city was something awesome years ago, I do wonder do you guys still play the game?<br><br>
	I think Vice City was more fun than what GTA San andreas and GTA V is, so is there people still playing this out there?

	It is with great pride that I recognize Project Redivivus for nine years of dedicated work and effort to the Multi Theft Auto project for our much beloved Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City games! Over the years, we have seen numerous people come and go, contributing massively to a project that has had deep meaning to many of the people in this community and others. Throughout this time, I have also met some of the kindest, funniest, and most-skilled people in my life. Having the chance to work alongside some of Multi Theft Auto's original developers has opened my eyes to some of the history of MTA and many other GTA multiplayer mods, and how they are what they are today. (The dedication put forth by the MTA team is nothing short of impressive). In the process, I've also seen quite a few of our own developers go on to officially work alongside the MTA team in multiple different capacities, thus helping to continue what we all know and love even more.
</p>

<p>
	To celebrate this long-standing group's birthday, I was hoping to officially release MTA 0.6 Nightly 2 to everyone. The plan was to push back the Windows XP/Boost fixes to 0.6 Nightly 3 so everyone could have something to play with in the mean time. Unfortunately our development team has run into an issue with compiling the Linux version of MTAServer, which is currently holding back this release. Fear not, though! We are still actively working on this, and hope that a resolution will be found within the coming days so everyone can have a late birthday gift from the PR team!
</p>

<p>
	Things are just around the corner, boys and girls. While 0.6 still has quite a bit of work left to be done on it before it can be open-sourced and released, significant progress has been made, and we are getting much closer to the end of it than ever before. This means that we'll hopefully be seeing releases to 0.7 and Blue also coming in the near future once the 0.6 base has been finalized for public use and view. Good things are coming. We just need a little more of your patience as we prepare them!

	Hi.
</p>

<p>
	I'm really interested in reversing and modding GTA, and i want research and may be improve old MTA releases.
</p>

<p>
	I'm interested in MTA 0.1(Admin Console source code no longer available for download) or MTA 0.2 source code.
</p>

<p>
	I think, someone can share this source under NDA or GPL license.
