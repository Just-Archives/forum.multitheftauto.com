(+ they don't even give credit to the mod author)</p>
<p>This is really annoying and i think there should be some kind of "report" function on the community center to report these people/ressources.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p><a href="https://community.multitheftauto.com/?p=resources&amp;s=details&amp;id=446" rel="external nofollow">https://community.multitheftauto.com/?p=resources ... ils&amp;id=446</a></p>

</p>

<p>
	The mods are clearly understaffed right now and people need to come to them, not the other way around. This is where you say "But wait, I contact mods and they never respond!!!". Well, usually the problem is you are only contacting ONE moderator. Now you can contact ALL moderators easily!
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Click</strong> the [ <img alt="icon_mini_mods.png" src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" data-src="http://forum.mtavc.com/templates/subSilver/images/icon_mini_mods.png">Contact the moderators ] button at the top right (next to profile, personal messages, login/logout) to contact the moderators. You can also click here:

</p>

<p>
	<strong>Enter</strong> your subject and message. This will create a message in a forum called "Complaints" that ONLY moderators can view. That means you will not be able to view the board or your submitted message.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>If</strong> this is not working for you, you can try the old fashioned method, sending a private message to 1 or more mods:

I might be wrong, but the staff/admins of the site didn't choose any of the entries from the Banner Search topic. It must of been Gamefreeks entry, because some of the images from his entry were included on the main site logo.</p>

<p>First, I wanna thank you for all the work you're putting into MTA:SA / the Blue Core ... ETC.  I understand you're all working very hard.  It's really time though that some of us got some kind of idea... of when you guys are (omg.. could the "R" word be coming up?)  Yes... realeasing, MTA:SA.</p>
<p>I know we've seen proof that it exists, I've got no question of that.  <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":P" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png"></p>
<p>However.. mentioned in this topic I found in the wastebin <a href="http://forum.mtavc.com/viewtopic.php?t=13812" rel="external nofollow">http://forum.mtavc.com/viewtopic.php?t=13812</a>   You guys were looking for a release in.. October. S'been 2 months.. and still no release. <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":|" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/mellow@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/mellow.png"></p>
<p>I'm sure you guys are working hard, and we <strong>ALL</strong> appreciate that.  If you could just give us some kind of HONEST, well thought out idea of when it's gonna come out... some of us would be able to sleep at night. <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="xD" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/laugh@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/laugh.png"></p>
<p>Or you might end up locking my topic saying you can't give out release dates.  <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":wink:" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/icon_wink.gif.66e8f2045a339ebd3f078830fc32935b.gif">   Either way, thanks for making MTA, It's freakin sweet.

<p>After much time looking into this i have come out with this conclusion. This server "70.68.179.81:2003" is named MTA No-Name Server 0.5. Well, it always has 26 players (Full) and it is always on. I looked into the server and either they are all bots OR the same people have idled in the server for 4 days now. It is really wierd and i would like if someone else could look into this 2. Also, all the pings are 0 so umm...sounds impossible to me. </p>
<p>Thx,</p>

This is really doing my head in now.</p>
<p>Since I zapped my PC I've been having problems with my graphics card. No hardware was changed, just a reinstall with the same hardware, and I think all the same software.</p>
<p>Since doing that, I started getting a pause in GTA:SA. CJ or any cars, etc would move for a second, pause for half, move for a second, etc. I tried all sorts of drivers for the card, but in the end tracked it down to Norton Anti-Virus. The Navapsvc.exe constantly take up between 19-42% of my processor. If I engage the internet lock and turn off Norton I can play fine. Obviously this will be a problem with MTA though.</p>
<p>I've run Norton, Adaware and Spybot, and all are clean. Any suggestions people?</p>

So people could read it before they post questions about the development.</p>
<p>Lets start with the most asked questions. This is intended mostly for new users.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:18px;">Very Frequently Asked Questions about MTA</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>MTA Blue</strong></p>
<p>Ok, the most questions are about Blue. Let me explain for new users what it is. Blue is a core (some kindda platform) , whereon all versions of MTA from now on will be build.</p>
<p>The first release on the blue core will be for San Andreas. </p>
<p>That release will be a racemod, they decided to make one because they want to show what they can do with the SDK ( for info about the SDK look at the part SDK of my topic ). So I hope this will stop all the people from saying "omg, why no deathmatch? No one cares about racing".</p>
<p>Deathmatch is planned for a <strong>later</strong> release and whining about it not being implented in the first release wont make it getting out sooner.</p>
<p><strong>What is an SDK?</strong></p>
<p>An SDK is a software development kit, allowing you to create your own modifications for the software the SDK is for. The SDK is being developed for MTA by the team so we can make our own gamemodes for MTA. It will </p>
<p>be in one of the future releases when they got it ready.</p>
<p><strong>The current MTA version and its core</strong></p>
<p>I saw so many people asking to develop 0.5.x further and release it. </p>
<p>Now, they won't do that because the new Blue core is way more organised too work with, and it will bring us way better MTA versions.</p>
<p>They will develop the blue core most likely for VC and ( if a great enough amount of people wants to have support for it ) GTA III.</p>
<p>Those are the most asked questions. If you see something I should add in it please tell me. I hope this clears up a lot for people and will stop many from posting things that have been asked lots of times before</p>
<p>For general 0.5 questions like this <a href="http://forum.mtavc.com/viewtopic.php?t=14549" rel="external nofollow">http://forum.mtavc.com/viewtopic.php?t=14549</a> I suggest you go the the Known Issues section for 0.5. It tells you the answer on many problems with 0.5. </p>
<p>You can find the known issues secion at : <a href="http://forum.mtavc.com/viewtopic.php?t=11098" rel="external nofollow">http://forum.mtavc.com/viewtopic.php?t=11098</a></p>
<p>If it still hasn't got the answer for you, post your problem in <a href="http://forum.mtavc.com/viewforum.php?f=50" rel="external nofollow">http://forum.mtavc.com/viewforum.php?f=50</a></p>
<p>So, think twice before you post ( and use the search function <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":P" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" width="20" height="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png"> )</p>
<p>Cheers, xGj.</p>
