<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-size:24px;"><strong>The history of PMG and Hawkeye</strong></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>(TLDR: We're a military type team that's been around since 2013 and has progressed to the tops of many servers thanks to our professional organization, training, team following and good sportsmanship. The team was eventually reorganized into a roleplay company yet still keeps the PMG name around for freeroam)</strong></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<strong><span style="font-size:12px;">I just thought some of you would want some history behind the team, so...</span></strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	 
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-size:16px;">Back when I was just starting out in MTA back in 2013-2014, I was the standard "having a gang looks cool, I want one" type of guy, so with the help of a server admin I was able to start a little ragtag group composed of four friends called PMG. Now of course, I was maybe 15-16 at the time and had no concept of anything that sounded cool, so the PMG stood for Psycho Mans Gang and was later adapted to <em>just</em> be called PMG. I quickly gained more members into the team - some loyal, some not so much - as we started forming a military sort of structure. Over the next months the team grew to be largely popular on the freeroam server we played on, with over 20 active members - even rivaling the server owners team. The server (SARP Romanian Freeroam, 2014/2015ish) owner was getting restless knowing another random team was becoming more popular than his team (called C.E.L.L.) and frequently tried to challenge our team. We of course won nearly every time, but after some time the owners ended up shutting the server down due to real life reasons.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-size:16px;">After SARP, we moved to another freeroam server that will not be named, as it's still online today. While in this server, being we were already an established team we required the owner to add a base map for the team, which grew our popularity further. In this server I think we ended up with 35+ members, not including team supporters that just didn't play on the same server as us but supported PMG. In this server, I met some of the first teammates i would end up being friends with for years, with a couple exceptions ive met in SARP. </span>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-size:16px;">After a demanding lead in that server after becoming the servers primary "sponsored" team for nearly a year, we learned SARP was coming back so we decided to go back, this time with a promise to co-run the server with the original owner and be the primary team with the big base and supporting scripts. The entire promise of being the main team ended up just being a long drawn out plan for the old owner to test my members and see which ones would be good enough for his CELL team's revival. few of my unloyal members joined him, while the others left with me and assisted in the proper payback for something of that nature.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-size:16px;">By this time (late 2016, early 2017) We decided to go back to the previous unmentioned server one last time with an even greater agreement to be the primary team, resulting in followers from original SARP, the second server, our second time in SARP, AND the second time in this server. We'd been growing rapidly, which meant we really bulked up on our members, training, skill and membership requirements, structure and devotion. There were now Generals and officers, and a separate pilots division as well as a separate smaller team of strictly romanian PMG members (since i didnt speak romanian, yet a lot of them did). We had vehicles and skins locked to ourselves, as well as an entire protected base and training area, and anything else we could ask for. Other teams would frequently try to combat us, which we would encourage and give a fair fight for the entertainment of both teams. Eventually there was a disagreement between the Romanian PMG members and myself and a good amount of them departed the group, which eventually resulted in me temporarily closing the group for some time.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-size:16px;">Around that time (2016) i was starting to get more into roleplay so although our 40+ team members and couple hundred followers were still loyal, I decided to take a break from the team to work on roleplay. I spent quite some time on Owlgaming, later moving to an old now shut down server I co-ran called Neptune Gaming. On Neptune, i wanted a team similar to PMG (since toward the end of PMG, we were so organized it was nearly an RPG/RP type team) but on roleplay. I took some aspects of PMG and disguised them into a team i ended up calling Hawkeye Corp, and added more details such as a membership secrecy contract, that was bound by execution if broken. We handled mostly assignments that were "illegal", but were corruptly given to us by the mayor of the town in exchange for police immunity if the cops were ever called on us, for whatever reason it may have been. The team was kept smaller than original PMG, only topping at roughly 16-18 members. Hawkeye Corp. would develop across a couple more RP servers over the next couple years before becoming a full-fledged company with an RP background and legitimate story.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-size:16px;">the PMG name is now primarily used when referring to freeroam, we've even attempted a team restart some years back, but couldn't find a suitable server. Hawkeye is primarily used when referring to a roleplay server, even though we've GREATLY reduced the amount of power given to us in RP servers over years.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<span style="font-size:16px;">Today, i'm still friends with a small handful of original PMG members from the early servers, and we're always ready to find the next freeroam server to make our home.</span>

Hi, my nickname is TBK or TheBakkese King. 

I have been playing GTA SA since 2004, in Play Station 2. And for more than 3 years MTA SA. 
After a great search I have seen that the flight sector in GTA is somewhat abandoned, when the game itself gives us great opportunities. 
So I want to gather all those who want to learn or already know how to do acrobatic flight. 

The planes I use for aerobatic flight are:

<p>Welcome! Are you looking to make some money off of MTA?</p>
<p>First of all, let me try to scare off some of you by saying, this is an advertising  job.</p>
<p>You will get payed a MAXIMUM of $100 USD/ Month.</p>
<p>Your payment will be based of how many LOYAL players you can get us, that's the catch.</p>
<p>There has been events where people would make accounts and try to get money, but of course, they get caught.</p>
<p>Anyways, I pay via <span style="color:#0000FF;">Pay</span><span style="color:#0080FF;">pal</span>. And you get 3 test days to determine how well you can advertise. </p>
<p>If I see any increase in players you will be payed.</p>
<p>Example: If there is 1 player online 24/7 when there used to be none, you get $1 USD for that month.</p>
<p>If there's an average of 25 players constantly online, you get $25 USD for that month, up to $100USD per month.</p>
<p>If you can get anyone to donate, you can have %25 of the money.</p>
<p>The other %75 will be split between getting an upgrade in CPU/Memory(%50) and the remaining %25 will go to MY POCKET! </p>
<p><span style="color:#400080;">What makes us different?</span> I challenge you to play this server for one hour only. You will see the difference 3 seconds in.</p>
<p>We are still under Heavy develpoment, we will not rush any progress. Life is long enough to put all of our time into this.</p>
<p><span style="color:#00BF00;"><span style="font-size:48px;"><strong>Server Information</strong></span></span></p>
<p>             <span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Only the worlds nicest admins wanted.</strong></span><span style="color:#0000FF;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000FF;">(Because there are no rules to enforce, only fun to be made)</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#0000FF;">(We will not hire you day one. we're not stupid server owners.</span></p>
<p><strong>Server ip:</strong> 167.114.47.146:22038</p>
<p><strong>Server name:</strong> <span style="color:#4000BF;">| Shamont's World | Your Home | No server related bullshit |</span></p>
<p>Everyone will automatically have (restricted) admin. No server takeover or game breaking stuff, of course.</p>
<p><span style="color:#0000FF;"><strong>Third party mods:</strong></span> This server is NOT full of third party mods, however some have been used, </p>
<p>ie: GTW(open source) job system.</p>
<p>This server DOES contain third party mods, however, none of which are stolen, and credit is given where it's due.</p>
<p>All mods/resources  were inspected personally for "Worms" and "Hijackers".</p>
<p>Actually as a matter of fact, i'll donate $1 USD+ to anyone that shows me I am using their mod. I know you deserve your cut.</p>
<p>You must provide some way to prove you own it, because people tend to be scammers.</p>

<p>I am here to inform you about the gang war that is going to happen on Sunday in LogiXGaming.ga [Roleplay] Server. This server has got a gang system compared to other roleplay server which generally have a turf system.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="2qalf6c.png" data-src="http://i62.tinypic.com/2qalf6c.png"></p>
<p>This is the place you need to go to join a gang. It is located near the beach in LS. You can join any gang you like but if you want to create your own gang then you will need $400k in-game cash.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="am79f9.png" data-src="http://i59.tinypic.com/am79f9.png"></p>
<p>These commands shown on the screenshot are gang commands. They will only be shown to players who are joined to a gang. The command "!gang" displays in which gang you are. "!ginfo" displays the number of area your gang control and the number of gang members. Finally, "!gexp" shows how much gang experience you have. GEXP can be earned by killing other gang members. You will receive +5 for normal kills and +7 for headshots. However, you will also lose your GEXP if you get killed by someone else or sucide.</p>
<p><img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="24qseh1.png" data-src="http://i59.tinypic.com/24qseh1.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="izu5iv.png" data-src="http://i61.tinypic.com/izu5iv.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="2qd4duf.png" data-src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2qd4duf.png"></p>
<p>The colourful area shown on the map above ^^ are all areas that can be captured by gangs. The back and white racing flag represents the area where there is a gang war going on. If your gang manages to get 6 kills or defends your area by getting 4 kills then all gang members who are online will get 1k as a reward from the server. For example- If your gang have 30 members and 20 of your gang members are online then if your gang manages to win an area then all 20 online members will get 1k each and that equals to 20k.</p>

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="Z4xvGkKm.png" data-src="http://i.imgur.com/Z4xvGkKm.png"></div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Rankin County Emergency Services Clan is one of the most advanced clans for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas at this time.  We are based around Rankin County in Mississippi.  We have everything from the volunteer fire departments to the sheriff’s office.  We do not have commissioners for a reason.  We built this clan around the model no one over another.  Each division has two division leaders to work on the board of division leaders.  All major clan decisions are made when every member of the board of division leaders approves and agrees with the motion.  We will never have any administrative fights this way thus causing less drama and a better role play experience.  As of recently we have gotten lucky enough to acquire the scripts used in First Response Multiplayer also known as SAPD:FR Online.  We have purchased these scripts to make everyone’s role play experience even better in the clan.  We do still have player civilians for the major events that just cannot be done by any script.  We are also currently working with Palm Beach Games to get stuff like undercover drug bust or baitcar added to the script.  But we are not forgetting Fire and EMS.  Fire and EMS plays a vital role in this clan.  Anytime an fire or ems is needed we hope to have the staff we need on hand to handle the call.  We currently have 2 fire departments in the clan, 1 a volunteer department another, a full-time paid department.  All departments have top of the line equipment.  Fire departments respond to all medical calls to start pre-ambulance care so when the American Medical Response ambulance the transporting agency for Rankin County can get the patient and be en-route to the hospital. AMR also has 2 supervisors which are actually considered sprint medics being they drive vehicles that carry anything in the back of an ambulance so they can respond to a call and assist a fire department that may not have a medic on duty for Level 1 calls.  This can mean the difference in life and death for some citizens in Rankin County.  If the on-scene commanders see it fit that ambulance transport would just be to slow for the patient they can call for University of Mississippi AirCare which is the only helicopter transport system in the area.  UMMC AirCare is in need of pilots and medics.  When any fire or ems scene turns for the worst not to worry Rankin County Emergency Operations Center is there.  Rankin EOC is in charge of all haz-mat or whether related events.  Rankin EOC also host the Rankin County Fire and EMS coordinator which is in charge of working with all fire departments and AMR to make sure everything is going smoothly.  EOC has members on staff 24/7 to respond to any calls that fire and ems departments may get where they see fit that a more experienced hand is needed.  All this couldn’t be possible without the dispatch division able to keep up with all units and alert them to the appropriate calls or locations.  Dispatch is a very stressful job and very hard to keep up with.  It is not for anyone.
