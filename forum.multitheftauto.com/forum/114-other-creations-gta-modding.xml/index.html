	Hello friends I have a question, I am using MySQL for the database and I have the login but once logged in, how do I send a request from the client to identify the user who makes the request??? This for those who program web, would be to save in the localStorage of the web page where I have stored the connected user and with whom I make the requests
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Or is it that I have to be carrying the user variable everywhere?
</p>

<p>
	Or sent to a file of type client a variable that is always there? but this would imply that this variable was lost due to some error?
</p>

	Hi!
</p>

<p>
	<br />
	I wanted to ask a simple question:<br />
	Assuming that vehicle's 3rd and 4th colors are free to use, are there any wheel models that could potentially use these color channels to alter their colors?
</p>

<p>
	Thanks in advance!
</p>
