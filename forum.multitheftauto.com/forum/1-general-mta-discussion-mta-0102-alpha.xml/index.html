Without the community the development wouldn't be that much fun.</p>
<p>When we decided to release our Alpha and beta versions we did it because we wanted to prove that it works.Now these days we sometimes regret that decision. When we read the forum or we are chatting on our IRC channel there's always someone asking when the next version will be released, what is changed and so on. Therefore we request not to post these questions anymore we had to lock several topics about it already on the forum. You can find all information we have ourselves on the forum in the anouncements under "General MTA Discussion"</p>
<p>When you start a new topic, please make sure the answer isn't already on the site or the forum. The forum has a search function. Try it first. We have found multiple topics that handle about the same thing. This means we have more work moderating and reading everything because we have to read things twice!</p>
<p>When you reply to a topic make sure you kniw what it is about and that you have read everything. A good example can be found in the anouncement of the delay. We find there the question about what a shuttle pc is. That question wasn't asked for the first time so the next posts says that you have to read the topic again and you will find the answer. The next post asks the same question again. That isn't normal. If you read a topic read it completely and not only the first 1 or 2 posts!</p>
<p>Spamming of the forum will not be allowed. We are gonna start a blacklist so we can monitor the people suspected of spamming a bit more. If we see people spamming after warnings we wil use the simplest solution: reset there number of posts because thats what spamming is all about isn't it? the most posts! I just have to go in the db and reset that number to 0 !</p>
<p>The speed problem of the site and forum aren't gonna be solved over 1 night but the biggest part of the problem should be solved within one or two weeks. Our host BASM has bought a complete rack @ IO.NL and is now looking for the correct materials they still need. The servers will be moved to there new location as soon as it is ready. This doesn't solve the speed problem because it is rtelated to server load, but together with the move a new server wil be installed. And another server is planned and will be installed before july.</p>
<p>We hope our message has been clear and hope we can keep getting the support of everyone!</p>
<p>The MTA team and forum moderators</p>

<p>I have found a lot of posts about Vice City Multiplayer but none with real info, so I just wounder will there come or if there already is one MP-mod for Vice City?</p>
<p>If me and my pal want to play MTA against eachother will it run smooth with minor lag if he is on a 2,5Mbit connection and hosts the server and I am on a 0,5Mbit connection?</p>
<p>I think u shoud add more info about MTA on the home page, and delete all old things that has been fixad and so on. Try to get in some more info about it, how it works, requirements and things like that.</p>
<p>thnx</p>

<p>I could not have dreamed of GTA3 being multiplayer! It's somethimg thats always lingered on the back of my brain!</p>
<p>I annoys me so bloddy bad that because of  sony it has caused the ceased operation of having Multiplayer built in to GTA3 <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":cry:" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/icon_cry.gif.d4ad6333b699ac0082c3b9d38cb62fed.gif"> ...

PC Rules!</p>
<p>I have played GTA Multiplayer with version .2 and had no problems it was fun but did have some problems with car sync etc... but from the looks of version .3 things will be a heap better and more fun!</p>
<p>just a question I have noticed that in some screenshoots on this Forum have the radar map showing dots for other players... is that part of .3 or a Radar Mod?</p>
<p>Thanks Guys keep up the good work!  <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":wink:" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/icon_wink.gif.66e8f2045a339ebd3f078830fc32935b.gif"></p>

Thanks, or any other help would be good, i really want to play. Thanks</p>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">856</guid><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2003 22:23:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Player models</title><link>https://forum.multitheftauto.com/topic/826-player-models/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>I'm asking about a .3 version.</p>
