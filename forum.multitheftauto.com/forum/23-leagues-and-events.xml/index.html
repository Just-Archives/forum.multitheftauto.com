<p style="text-align:center;">
	<br>
	Its the time to see yourself in a bright light to stand against the sun and not watching your shadow behind. We are here to present a marvellous and most fascinating event ever organized for our Destruction Derby Community from Multi Theft Auto San Andreas. With the collaboration of our previous organizers such as <strong>'TC|sEEk</strong> and off-course <strong>KekZ|#Zayn</strong> we are giving out our destruction derby a new era of entertainment with no such wars between teams or clans.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	This time its all about you and yourself to show the world around the skills you got. In esports, we often talk about gamers who "want it" more than others.These are the players who show up early, who use up every last ounce of energy in pursuit of their best performance. Players for whom defeat is viscerally painful, the ones who will stop at nothing to succeed. It's now our job to inspire and channel the motivation and use it to maximize the community's performance.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	This league is all about the pleasure to have from the different modes of Destruction Derby that we are presenting to you. Their will be no knockouts so no worry for anyone to be part of us for a little time. Every player will stand with us till last day of league and never misses the joy. Their will be three modes of league with their own rules and regulations to play. Following are the there DD Game modes which we gonna have throughout the league days.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	1. <span style="color:#ff3333;"><strong>H</strong></span><strong>ead-</strong><span style="color:#ff3333;"><strong>t</strong></span><strong>o-</strong><span style="color:#ff3333;"><strong>h</strong></span><strong>ead </strong><span style="color:#ff3333;"><strong>D</strong></span><strong>D</strong><br>
	2.<span style="color:#ff3333;"> </span><span style="color:#ff3333;"><strong>J</strong></span><strong>ump </strong><span style="color:#ff3333;"><strong>C</strong></span><strong>lash </strong><span style="color:#ff3333;"><strong>D</strong></span><strong>D</strong><br>

</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<strong>Starting with the first, Head-to-head DD. </strong>This gamemode involves the Cross Destruction Derby Maps with checkpoints to get them all till the finish point. Yes folks, this is the DD Race Mode where everyone can participate to show their vehicle driving skills. Every round 3 players have to finish to get points according to their ranks from 1st to 3rd. Every round after 3 players finishes, the map will be changed and similarly each time we will be playing 10 maps. And that's not it, this system will go on whole day where after every 3 hours the event will be started. This way we will have the event running for the whole day. Point system will be recorded by wins, ranks and top times. So got good skills to run? then try to run for yourself!<br><strong>For more info about the mode click</strong> <a href="http://kekz.vacau.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=35" rel="external nofollow"><span style="color:#ff3333;">HERE</span></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<strong>Secondly, Jump Clash DD. </strong>This gamemode involves also the Destruction Derby Cross Maps just with a little modification of jumps. Every player will be able to jump and every 5 sec jump reloads. The system will be same like after every 3 hour event will be played with 10 maps but here we will have a modification of TDM. Yes fellows, their will be a team death match with this system also. Every player will be set to random team by generator. Stats will be recorded in the server like kills, assists, wins, ratio etc.<br><strong>For more info about the mode click</strong> <a href="http://kekz.vacau.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=36" rel="external nofollow"><span style="color:#ff3333;">HERE</span></a>
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<strong>Third, Stunt Battle DD. </strong>By the name you all can guess what you will have to do. Yes fellows this mode will involve only your own skills to show off. Random matches will be generated for player vs player. Each player will show his stunt where opponent will have to perform it same as player does. During the time of Stunt Battle, we will enable the pvp system for other two modes also where we will organize matches for players to challenge others for pvp in these 3 modes.<br><strong>For more info about the mode click</strong> <a href="http://kekz.vacau.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?fid=37" rel="external nofollow"><span style="color:#ff3333;">HERE</span></a>

</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:16px;">It all started off more than <a href="https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Timeline" rel="external nofollow">12 years ago</a>, when the original release of Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas kickstarted a completely new era of multiplayer gaming in the GTA series. Back then, the MTA experience was nothing like it is nowadays; very basic vehicle synchronization and a only limited set of gamemodes existed - <strong>Race, Freeroam, DeathMatch and Demolition Derby</strong>. In fact, one could not even leave his vehicle, meaning all the action had to take place sitting in a car. Sounds quiet boring, doesn't it? Why would anyone play this? Well, the revolutionary Map Editor and a devoted community of enthusiasts managed to create something amazing out of the little they had. To name a few honorable communities that even I myself came across: PhrozenByte, littlewhitey's, SKC and DDC. Take a look at the server browser back in the good ol' days.</span>

	<span style="font-size:16px;">Today, FFS Gaming is proudly carrying on the Racing legacy bringing together decade-old traditions and fresh innovations. We improved and re-invented several aspects of the Racing scene over the years with the goal of making it even more enjoyable for the casual player. Especially the transtion from <strong>DeathMatch to Who Finishes First</strong> was a controversial, yet groundbreaking decision which allowed for tons of new competitive formats to be created. One of them being <strong>Who Finishes First: Old School</strong> to which we are adding a <strong>100€ Prize Pool</strong>!</span>

<p style="text-align:center;">
	<strong><span style="color:#f39c12;"><span style="font-size:26px;">What's the tournament about?</span></span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	<br><span style="font-size:16px;">Who Finishes First: Old School is an open tournament based on passing maps further and faster than your competitors. The core concept is very similar to conventional Race - just without any checkpoints. Top-4 players who passed the longest distance on the map receive <strong>3, 2, 1 and 1 points</strong> accordingly. The Map Pool consists of <strong>20 maps</strong> that are generally considered "oldschool" - they were mainly created and played back in <strong>2009-2011</strong>. So called "speed maps" with a smooth track, lack of slow and BMX parts. Not too hard maps, but definitely challenging enough to make you have a hard time competing. Take a look at one of the tournament's maps yourself:</span>

	<strong>Hello again folks!</strong>
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	I want to manage a tournament - league Race tournament played on Classic Race gamemode in MTA San Andreas - in a server called: uDka Racing [im admin on it]
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	<strong>HOW IT WILL LOOK LIKE:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	- you will have map list - every team need to select max. 5 maps
</p>

<p>
	- minimum of members are 2, or 3 - maximum are 10 [still 5 v 5 cw]
</p>

<p>
	- there will be a site with the stats from the tournament
</p>

<p>
	- CW script similar to CS:GO games [you can insert team logo there, or flag - if you want your logo - send me!]
</p>

<p>
	<strong>YOU NEED:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	- have free time to play matches [if you dont have - don't worry - we can arrange match for another day]
</p>

<p>
	- don't abandon the tournament when you registered already
</p>

<p>
	- as said before minimum 2, 3 members and maximum 10 [for substitutes]
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	<b>How to register? * is optional</b>
</p>

<p>
	 - reply to this thread by this example post:
</p>

<p>
	*TEAM NAME -
</p>

<p>
	*TEAM COLOR [in #fff (fff)] -
</p>

<p>
	*TEAM COUNTRY [for example - if you're all germans - germany or if you have mixed country members - EU, but if you have logo you can send the link here or the pic, we will place the logo not the flag] -
</p>

<p>
	*MEMBERS IN THE TEAM - 
</p>

<p>
	Description of the team -
</p>

<p>
	Last competetions where you performed -
</p>

<p>
	Server when the event will be: mtasa://212.92.230.230:22003
</p>

<p>
	If you have servers, and you selected some maps from map pool - i can send you - contact by facebook with me: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ku.bus.52035" rel="external nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/ku.bus.52035</a>
</p>

<p>
	I'll update post here - if max. 10 teams will register [add maps to select, and schelude days and groups]
</p>

<p>
	Hope you will register here <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" srcset="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/smile.png"></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hello MTA players,</p>
<p>I am glad to announce you today a new tournament for the community !</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mtasa-dd.com" rel="external nofollow">http://www.mtasa-dd.com</a> team present :</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">"The international destruction derby championships"</span></strong></p>
<p>Registration is already open, and tournament will be started when we will get 16 teams!</p>
<p>First is group stage with 8 teams in each group, both groups will fight all vs all (3vs3...vs3)</p>
<p>Then play off with upper and lower brackets, first 4 places from each group - upper bracket, another teams - lower bracket.</p>
<p>Prize for the clan winner is <strong>100 euros</strong>, more details in our special page (see below).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What is mtasa-dd team ?</span></strong></p>
<p>This is the place specially for Descturction Derby community.</p>
<p>The main target of this site, to make clan wars more fair, because now there is a lot of problems like guys who abusing admin rights during cw, or not existence of "official" rules for cws, etc.</p>
<p>So we wrote the rules for clan wars and made the forum for results of cws, if someone was abusing admin rights, you just put the screen with proofs, and their team get -1 karma or +1 warning (such function will be added soon). Before cw you can check profile of any team and see their karma to make decision if its good idea to play against them. Btw this is resolving the problem when teams dont want add their defeats on their site, now all will see results on our site.</p>
<p>This is will works only if teams and players will support this site and idea. We are welcome for your questions and suggestions on our forum, everything in your hands.</p>
<p>Except this, we made another things like media page, list of clans, function to get subforum for guys who wanna make the tournament or any event, etc</p>
<p>We will continue to work with it till we have ideas, but as we said - everything in your hands because its nothing without your support.</p>

<p>As you probably figured out, it is gonna be a sequel of the previous DD tournament XIII held, exactly 1 year ago (yeah, long time). You will participate with your team (teams of 3 players), and you will only play  1 vs 1 matches (team matches). You will firstly choose 2 of the DD maps from the main server, maps which you are gonna use in every single match of yours.</p>
<p>We are looking for as many teams as possible to register. The matches will be chosen randomly and after each match, the team which losses gets knocked-out of the tournament. The teams which go further are to play against each other in the upcoming stages. Every match will consist of 12 rounds (each of the 4 maps to be played 3 times). If any match will end up with a tie, there'll be an extra round.</p>
<p>What you need to do in order to register is to mention in a comment below the 3 members of your team, the name of your team and the 2 maps which you want to use in the tournament. If you're willing to play but you don't have a team, feel free to state it in a comment - you might get lucky and find some teammates!</p>
<p>Ah well, the dates aren't set yet. All we know is that it is gonna take place in january!  We're gonna set a date which we hope to be good for each of the participants, but we'll do it a bit later. </p>
<p>The prize will be a symbolic amount of ingame money, of course, the real prize is the fun!</p>
<p>1st $ 200 000</p>
<p>2nd $ 125 000</p>
<p>3rd $ 75 000</p>
<p>4th $ 25 000</p>
<p>per team member.</p>
<p>Good luck to everyone, we're hoping to see many people interested in this and registering asap! <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Registrations ending on the 2nd of January!</span></p>
<p><em>Best regards, Dan3z &amp; Neyts</em></p>

<p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>in this topic you'll see latest news about our upcoming tournament.</p>
<p>We are planing to organize a new tournament - a shooter tourney for teams.</p>
<p>You'll be participating with two other players in your team again, cause we thought, that you would like to play with your teammates from the previous tournament again - you're also able to choose other teams and teammates of course.</p>
<p>This time we gonna split up the fights for sure, cause it will be a mess when all teams are playing at the same time. We'll decide about the way we gonna play, so far we've got the amount of teams. Also the amount of rounds and maps will set later.</p>
<p>The date we gonna play is probably any sunday in january or at the latest in the beginning of february.</p>
<p>I'll be able to tell you the exact date in the beginning of the new year, cause then I'll know, when I have to work.</p>
<p>In the upcoming shooter tournament, not all players will get something for the participation like last time. This time just the three winner teams will earn something more than just honour.</p>
<p>Here a little To-Do-List for your registration:</p>
<p>Tell us your ingame name.</p>
<p>If you got a team already, then please also tell us the names of your teammates.</p>
<p>What's the name of your team?</p>
<p>Please tell us 2 or 3 of your favourite shooter maps.</p>
<p>Which time would you like to play on a sunday?</p>
<p>If you got any suggestion or questions feel free to post it here, furthermore we already wish you good luck and a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
