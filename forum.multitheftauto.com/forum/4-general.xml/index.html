	The partyserver needs to be back up for both sa-mp, and <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto"><abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">mta</abbr></abbr> vice city, its dead like you see here:<br />
	<br />
	[removed]<br />
	<br />
	And it took years to realize we miss the servers and game, some people want back to the game but there is no forums for sa-mp, so we need to understand how the community can survive again and build new servers, for both <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto"><abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr></abbr>:VC and Sa-MP death match, role-playing is not that bad but DM will always be the best.<br />
	<br />
	We should all aspire that the forums will be back up so that everybody knows about the games, and can upload servers to them on their computers or other.<br />
	<br />
	The <abbr title="Grand Theft Auto"><abbr title="Grand Theft Auto">GTA</abbr></abbr> community should not die out.<br />
	<br />

	Hello Community, Hello Legends, How you doing, I hope you're all alright.
</p>

<p>
	Well am gonna directly talk hh
</p>

<p>
	I've been playing <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr> for 10 years since 2010 to 2020 and like most of you we've started like newbies then we upgrade ourselves by the time.
</p>

<p>
	As you know most of ppl are focusing on FiveM, no comparison  here, quality, cars models and reality..etc.
</p>

<p>
	Well I had a server before, I was having fun, we all grown up with <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr> and we all have memories, we've made a lot of friends, we've got virtual relations and some ppl got a real one.
</p>

<p>
	Well as I can see there's nothing new in <abbr title="Multi Theft Auto">MTA</abbr>, I've spent a lot of time playing and scripting, I made new graphic mods to make the game enjoyable but no results, What I would say that day by day this game is dying, We may have to support the community to improve the game performance, Some ads may help too.
</p>

<p>
	Am a lover and a supporter, I would like to get back but work and responsibilities took all ma'time so<br />
	A message to the community admins, please survive the game and thanks.
</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	- Best regards

	The new open.mp client for GTA Defintive edition trilogy is gonna be good, but they can't even update their forums.<br />
	<br />
	On google you can find this:<br />
	<br />
	Burgershot<br />
	<a href="https://burgershot.gg" rel="external nofollow">https://burgershot.gg</a><br />
	You can find information about on going discussions, programming/scripting advice and tutorials. Forum, Threads, Posts, Last Post.<br />
	SA-MP<br />
	You can post any SA-MP related youtube videos, images from ...<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	But they can't even update their forums to the real domain, open.mp and openmultiplayer.com, this is embarrassing since lots of people buy the game in store and will laugh at them, since they can't update their forums with the right url.
</p>

<p>
	<br />
	What you guys think, sade-mp or open.mp which one has better forums? <span>:)</span>

	Heard the news yet? Official news has broken out about <strong>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition</strong>. Looks like Rockstar Games will begin removing GTA San Andreas classic from the digital stores. You will still be able to play but not purchase new copies anymore. Buy your digital GTA San Andreas copies while you still can!
</p>

<p>
	I did find some random news articles about this:

<p>
	I like to think that MTA is kept alive by nostalgia so that it won't impact us too much, but who knows?

	Hello MTA community,
</p>

<p>
	for quite a while I have been thinking about the Lua language. I think that we can all agree on this fact: that the Lua language is simple and beautiful, especially inside MTA San Andreas. Would any of you be interested in a service that lets you compile Lua directly into machine code, for example into a stand-alone PE executable file? I am not talking about srlua or LuaJIT, rather a completely new application/web service where you could queue your Lua code for compilation. There are major benefits to compiling to machine code rather than Lua bytecode. When I'd finish this project then I would implement a C++ interface and port it into MTA aswell.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Benefits of machine code translation</b>
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Speed boosts during script execution due to native format of the code
	</li>
	<li>
		Code cannot be reversed into Lua anymore
	</li>
	<li>
		Lua code optimizations that the reference Lua compiler does not perform (constant optimizations, function inlining, computation node grouping, loop unrolling, etc)
	</li>
	<li>
		The ability to market your programs
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I am thinking about a future business partnership with the MTA team where electronically-signed machine code translated from Lua would be securely run on MTA clients. The modernization of the Lua component would bring more freedom in designing the future scripting possibilities too.
</p>

<p>
	If you guys voice enough interest for this product then I would be greatly encouraged to create it. There is no such product available yet and it's creation would be both interesting and challenging. What do you think, community member?
</p>

<p>
	- Martin

	<u><strong>Hello all ....</strong></u><br />
	There was <strong>an old game</strong>, I don't remember its name. It was <strong>similar to a pirate game</strong>. The game <strong>had a specific story</strong>. I searched a lot, but unfortunately, I couldn't find the game. In the game, <strong>the hero gets arrested and frees himself.</strong>

	Hello developers,
</p>

<p>
	I have just found out today about the launch of <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/" rel="external nofollow">Visual Studio 2022</a>. There appears to be a <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/launch/" rel="external nofollow">launch event along a featured livestream aswell</a>. (Kind of psycho how Bing is tracking URL-clicks using newtabredir-redirection now similar to Google). But more interestingly there is a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/visualstudio/ide/whats-new-visual-studio-2022" rel="external nofollow">list of changes</a>. It is a bunch of bla-bla and if you just want my word for it, as professional a user I am, then go for the upgrade. Give it a try. They did not mess it up and it looks much more beautiful than before. Do not forget to reconfigure the IDE options (turn off automatic formatting, disable Git addon, set to use spaces and not tabs) though because they do not take over these settings!
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="visual-studio-2022.png" class="ipsImage" data-ratio="75.08" height="598" style="height:auto;" width="1000" data-src="https://green-candy.osdn.jp/external/forumuploads/visual-studio-stuff/visual-studio-2022.png" src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" />
</p>

<p>
	If you don't like crammed source lines, as displayed in the above picture due to the fatter and more readable font, then consider increasing the distance of source lines in the IDE configuration.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="vs2022-avoid-crammed-source-lines.png" class="ipsImage" data-ratio="75.08" height="670" style="height:auto;" width="1000" data-src="https://green-candy.osdn.jp/external/forumuploads/visual-studio-stuff/vs2022-avoid-crammed-source-lines.png" src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" />
</p>

<p>
	Or just switch back to the good-old Consolas font. It works better in my opinion, even if it is a very fine detail related to the spacing on the top.
</p>

<p>
	Have fun!
</p>

	<em>This post is my personal statement. It could be detached from views of other members of this board. I invite everyone into an open discussion that follows the rules of this forum.</em>
</p>

<p>
	In this article I want to talk about the meaning of copyright in contrast to how the wild specimen known as gamer perceives it. It is my careful accumulation of experiences around here-unnamed internet communities. It is a delicate subject in the case of vibrant communities that express themselves in their identity surrounding copyrighted works. But there appear to be misunderstandings regarding facts such as the untouchability of present copyright holders, much profoundedly so due to being champions and creators of said works, and their enactable rights. Thus an unbiased observer, taking no defaulted side could be confused if not deluded about what is right in this situation.
</p>

<p>
	Let's start by explaining the intentions of good-faith which the core values of our society build upon. They overreach the primitive understanding of laws as expressions of restriction. In a commercial direction we want to cherish - the action in good-faith - entrepreneurs who create works and take the initial risk to distribute this previously unheard-of content. More works will be encouraged if we protect their commercial interest in creations. It fundamentally brings us together as community to act as protectors of (copy-)rights as well as the procedures of lawful acquirements. The essence of buying a work - the driving factors of markets, innovation - is agreed upon by the copyright holder in his distribution interest. We must never forget the interconnectedness of the good-faith that has spawned its roots into every facet of todays society to keep our world intact.
</p>

<p>
	Disdainfully in eyes of creators could be a creeping misunderstanding of good-faith. As an entrepreneur - good-faith creators of favorable works - it has to be your natural reflex to protect yourself against it. Starting with the most-generous opening argument we could say that there are people who have been tricked into downloading software - which has a lot of man-hours of work behind it, countless of designers smithing away in their creativity - without permission on the internet. Down this line more radical are people who consider that abandonware is a legal concept and that it in principle could overrule the copyright. Worse yet, the entrepreneur could enter the attempted dispute with a legal entity about the value of aging works and their copyright enactability. But I digress.
</p>

<p>
	When laws change, good-faith keeps us together. A world where creators work for free hardly exists in good-faith. Oh joy, they get to distribute the new excitement to everyone, but their kids at home starve amongst the countless spent man-hours. On the other hand a world with rising yet unexplained prices is risking a growing, deeply-rooted misunderstanding by the consumers. In particular a good businessman does keep both sides - the accountability and the protectivity - in good balance.
</p>

<p>
	We started this article by mentioning gamers. These people consume works of the game industry. The game industry is a set of companies with many designers, programmers, sound/visual/expressionary artists and their suits. With each game - a work of said industry - each of the previously mentioned industry components wants to get paid during the making process as well as afterwards to continue a good-faith job. It is my - the article authors - point of view that many gamers do not understand how hard it is to make and sell a game. We as a society have to raise the importance of copyright with truthful explanations of the work that resulted in said rights. Then can we expect the newcomer to understand the core-values of our society.
</p>

<p>
	I - the article author - want to apologize for leaving this delicate topic on this unfinished note. May you have a good and understanding future about the topics explored herein.
</p>
