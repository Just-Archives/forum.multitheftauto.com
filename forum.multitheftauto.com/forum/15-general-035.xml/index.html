We decided to spend the next few weeks on bughunting and improvements to the current version. The next version of MTA will be 0.3.5 and will have the following features:</p>
<p>* improved netcode (fixes lag problem and creates real sync)</p>
<p>* all new GUI</p>
<p>* less bugs</p>
<p>* if possible : voice chat (depends on bandwith needs, maybe make it optional)</p>
<p>Other improvements like game modes and chat may come in 0.3.5 but are not the top priority at this moment. If not included they will stay planned for 0.4 .</p>

<p>Anyway I have a limeted amount of download useage that I can use before I have to wait till the end of the month.  I was thinking that if you could put <strong>extra</strong> effort in making MTA with less bandwidth useage it would be better for every one.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Good Points are:</span></p>
<p><strong>Less lag (pings)</strong> &gt; more players &gt; more fun &gt; more players</p>
<p><strong>Less bandwidth used</strong> &gt; more (happy) players</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Bad points:</span></p>
<p><strong>More work for you</strong> &gt; slow releases &gt; un-happy people</p>
<p>Another way of solving this is a custom upload limet and download limet.  This would mean that you could change the upload limet to <strong>anything</strong> and there be a nother tab for the download limet witch should also be custom.  This wouls allow the user full control and awearness over what they are useing of their limeted internet or not useing up all the bandwith if their useing internet shearing with others.</p>

But i think it's now time for coming back to the original GTA 3:MTA! It's been a wile since the last version (0.3b) and it's sucks. At least compared to VC:MTA! So, now, then the core 0.3.1 is ready, continue with GTA 3, please! Vice 0.3 can wait. GTA 3 is a great game, and the feeling of it is totally diffirent from Vice. And don't forget about boats, becouse of lack of helicopters.  <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt=":wink:" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/icon_wink.gif.66e8f2045a339ebd3f078830fc32935b.gif"></p>]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">3158</guid><pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2003 22:45:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why is the process not going faster? &lt;question&gt;]]></title><link>https://forum.multitheftauto.com/topic/1402-why-is-the-process-not-going-faster-ltquestiongt/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>are you guys only use the last version or take a whole new plan and begin all </p>

<p>This will simplify the 'race' challenge.  Have a hotkey to send a message to everyone saying "Race Mode Started"  Then the person that has invoked this can travel along and drop off nice waypoints such as those found in "Bling Bling Scramble".  When they are done, it sends a message that the race will start (at the first waypoint)  when some arbitrary number of people show up.  Then they will have to follow all the waypoints in order as a type of race.  The first person to collect all waypoints and end up at the finish will win.  Then the process can start over.  Sound good?  Possible?  Let me know something.</p>

Ofcourse, I'm speaking about GTA3 so don't confuse my post with VC related issues. </p>
<p>- My question/suggestion would be, have the programmers ever thought about including a visual ingame feaure that lets other players know who you are? Meaning, once you enter the game, your nickname would pop up in the top left hand corner of the game screen notifying other players who you are. This would also enable users to acquire the knowledge that a new person joined the game. I think it would be a nice and useful feature... this way there wouldn't so much confusion as to how many players are in the game and it would be nice to know who's playing while you're driving around instead of having to resort to alt + tab to view the console of players.</p>
<p>- My next suggestion/idea would be, you guys suppose you could implement an easier way to communicate with others? Such as perhaps pressing a chosen key on the keyboard to active the chat function? Some may want to communicate while in the game in order to decide on a place to race or ask where the other player is currently at. ( i know, that's what the map is for) But in this form, people could ask specific people where they're at, not just take a guess by going to every player listed on the map screen. It would be an excellent addition to the game instead of having to alt + tab again to pause your game and look @ what others are saying/asking.</p>
<p>- Just a thought, probably won't be applied but I think it would be a neat feature. If you've covered a similar concept on another post, disregard this post.   <img src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/applications/core/interface/js/spacer.png" alt="8)" data-src="https://forum.multitheftauto.com/uploads/emoticons/icon_cool.gif.9615b842ac68bc0924fa23ddcd6e8256.gif"></p>
