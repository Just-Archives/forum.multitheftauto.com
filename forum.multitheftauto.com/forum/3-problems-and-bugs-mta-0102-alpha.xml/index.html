Please HELP!! I can't fix this problem!!</title><link>https://forum.multitheftauto.com/topic/4272-dont-work-please-help-i-cant-fix-this-problem/</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Ok I have an ORIGINAL Italian version of GTA: vice city.</p>
<p>I Installed and re-installed it a pair of times but MTA extension doesn't work!!</p>
<p>I tried both self-extracting and .ZIP MTA but none of them works...</p>
<p>Ok, when starting MTA client I had an "unhandled exception" crash so I copied italian.gtx file in the \MTA directory and now the game started..</p>
<p>The original \MTA directory was containing only "american.gtx" file</p>
<p>The original \TEXT directory was containing the following files:</p>
<p>-american.gtx</p>
<p>-french.gtx</p>
<p>-italian.gtx</p>
<p>-spanish.gtx</p>
<p>-german.gtx</p>
<p>Now, It still doesn't works...</p>
<p>I tried both 1.0 and 1.1 game versions but:</p>
<p>If I launch the game in 1.0 version It starts, I select NEW GAME and It loads... then the "tip of the day" and "chat" menus appears... the player selection appears and weapons above the player rotates but after a few seconds the game crashes instead when I hears the engine of a car starting.... The image is freezed and the game is blocked.</p>
<p>If I launch the game in 1.1 version It starts, loads and crashes instead the tip of the day menu appears but this time an "unhandled exception" appears in the following:</p>
<p>"UNHANDLED EXCEPTION: c0000005 at address 00652f30"</p>
<p>I reinstalled the game two or three times in order to get a "clean" installation but It didn't solve my problem.</p>
<p>I tried to copy all of the .gtx files from my TEXT dir. to MTA dir included the American.gtx file (the american.gtx file dimension that is there in TEXT dir is different by american.gtx file included in MTA dir) but the problem is still the same: IT CRASHES!!</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP!! I would really like to play this wonderful videogame in multiplayer mode!! PLEASE HELP ME TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM!!</p>
<p>THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</p>
<p>Gotcha!</p>

<p>I have this bug, so i cant cause damage on enemys/other peoples. First, i had no idea and i never could kill people on server. And if i asked for this bug never answered me. As i tried third and fourth time 1 poeple did a answer and said to me that the hitboxes are wrong. He told me i have to shot a litle right of the person, on the right arm or something.</p>
<p>Ok i did it and had little success, i see its really possible to kill people but its really tiresome;</p>
<p>I didnt know exactly where to hit, so its every time a gambling where i have to shot. I didnt (cant) hit the enemy, if he is moving. And if i use a normal gun (for example pistols) i wouldnt have a chance. I need really really hard guns, and i mean HARD guns to kill people. Fuck off UZZIs, light guns, light machineguns, grenades, molotovs etc. Thats what i need to kill people is the really heavy machine gun (not the railgun but the gun with 100round on a mag). M16 works "fine" too --&gt; not really good but it works. Otherwise (with all normal guns) i cant kill people.</p>
<p>So whats this shit?</p>
<p>And please dont say "every people got that bug" i saw many people shootin on me with pistol when i was running, tricksing, jumping and i died.</p>
<p>Please help me with this ******* bug</p>

They originally worked but recently they stopped.  I am not doing anything weird.  I am running that restart utility but it worked with this before.  I few weeks ago I cured this problem by re-installing MTA.  This time I have re-installed MTA and ASE and no luck.  I can still play but that meter and names come in handy.  </p>
<p>I think I have read every post in this forum and I didn't see this issue.  If I missed it please point me in the right direction.  </p>

<p>I am running a LAN with 2 computers. We let  both load MTA to the credits (we've tried from the menu as well), we run a server on one computer, then type in the ip address of the server on the other. the computers connect although there is a message on the server that says "another player tried to connect with the same ip".  </p>
<p>when the serving computer hits the send game request we get a runtime error that says "Run-time error '10049':  Address family is not supported"</p>
<p>both computers are running XP Pro which was the case on 2 of the other 3 postings about the same runtime error. the third posting said that MTA was running fine on XP.</p>
<p>is MTA not compatable with XP-Pro or wtf is goin on</p>
<p>i would appriceate some help, thanks</p>
