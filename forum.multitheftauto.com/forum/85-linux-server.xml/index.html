	Hello, I have a problem with "math.random" on the client side. Namely, I would like to draw numbers after reconnecting to the server. However, after resetting the resource it actually works, but when the player does "/ reconnect" the numbers are always the same. My test feature is:
</p>

<p>
	random1, random2, random3, random4, random5 = math.random (1.10000), math.random (1.10000), math.random (1.10000), math.random (1.10000), math.random ( 1,10000)<br />
	outputChatBox (random1 .. "," ..random2 .. "," ..random3 .. "," ..random4 .. "," ..random5)
</p>

<p>
	Result:<br />
	- After restarting the resource the commands / restart actually gets random numbers,
</p>

<p>
	but after connecting to the server, he always receives the same numbers again: 93, 3486, 6439, 3433, 4146<br />
	<br />

	Hello,
</p>

<p>
	we are struggling with the server crashes mentioned in the title for about a month.<br />
	As for the script page - we did not introduce any major changes that could cause this, additionally we analyzed all the scripts on the server side and we did not find any imperfections. Script side memory leak does not exist, RAM usage is less than 300MB regardless of server uptime.
</p>

<p>
	Crashes occur at totally random times. Once, the server crashed immediately after it was started (before the resource autostart script was started, i.e. no resources were running)<br />
	We use the latest version of the stable linux server.
</p>

<p>
	Below I am attaching a few dumps and kernel logs where the problem is also visible.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	I would like to ask for a quick solution to the case as this problem has a negative impact on player satisfaction.<br />
	If it comes in handy - Sky.#7054 is my discord, you can write to me also there.

<p>
	Can external connections from my server to the mta server give players time out?
</p>

<p>
	My players at some point take time out from the server for no reason, my dedicated is online and without problems, I can execute commands on the MTA console but for players who are in it is time out as if the server had gone down.
</p>

<p>
	I took a look at the logs and the only reason I found this was the protection of the dedicated bar ips.

	Hi! I have a VPS with Ubuntu OS, and I would like to make a server starter wich i can use trough a website, so i could manage the server in a website. But the problem is that I don't know how to do it. I thought  I should make a service file wich starts the mta server, and it works fine but it can't stop the server. Do you have an idea how could I make it?

		You can take a look on it here:

		<br />
		By using containers, you can easily set limits for each server, like CPU and RAM limits.<br />

		I was using it only for personal purpose, and decied to share here.<br />

	I am having a little problem with my server, I have a multi gamemode script and a VPS with 1GB of RAM, after an hour or so the server crashes due to memory limitations, it seems that it reaches the 1GB of RAM limit, and since the VPS doesn't have swap, the server crashes.
</p>

<p>
	I use mySQL and there are no 'big' variables server-side, almost all request are sent to mySQL (for example, to get map name)
</p>

<p>
	When I start the server the first time, the memory usage is around 350mb
</p>

<p>
	If I stop all the resources, the memory doesn't go down, so for example if memory usage is 700mb and I stop all resources (actually, it's only ONE resource that holds everything), the memory stays on 700mb.
</p>

<p>
	Is the solution to get more RAM or there is another issue?
</p>

<p>
	Thanks.
